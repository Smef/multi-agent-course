BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology,\\noperational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology\\napplications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with\\nindependent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers\\n(“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal\\npreparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).”\\nMobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks.\\nWe use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight\\nindustry.\\nOur technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada,\\nLatin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nOur Segments\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and\\nFreight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\\nMobility\\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars,\\nauto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We\\ncalculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide\\nour Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar\\nridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including\\nhistorical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and\\nmarketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of\\nthe world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into\\nsuch transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and\\nYandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\\nDelivery\\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant\\nor have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\\nwell as select other goods. We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also\\nincreases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings\\nby accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people\\nwho are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In\\naddition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery\\ncapability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more\\nconsumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an\\nall-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated\\nCornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our\\nDelivery business with Drizly’s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a\\nbusiness combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nFreight\\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and\\nexperience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and\\nthe ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days,\\nfor shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly\\nfragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n7/260\\nbook the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies\\nadversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles,\\n4\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n8/260\\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-\\ndemand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our\\nplatform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender\\nshipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to\\ndelivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand\\nour Uber Freight business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. The acquisition of Transplace has been\\naccounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8,\\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nPlatform Synergies\\nOur Platform\\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together,\\nthese elements power movement from point A to point B.\\nMassive Network\\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers,\\nMerchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our\\nnetwork becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January\\n1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually\\nbillions, of people.\\nLeading Technology\\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are\\nthe core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and\\npricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and\\noperationalize existing ones.\\nOperational Excellence\\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly\\nlaunch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and\\nbuild and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.\\nProduct Expertise\\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-\\ndemand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and\\nfunctionality, and deliver safety and trust.\\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen\\nengagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value\\nof our platform to platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.0 Trips\\nper month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We believe that\\nthese trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched\\nUber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members\\nhave access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber\\nPass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership\\nprograms are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2021\\nwith over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our\\n“Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for\\nour consumers.\\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform\\nnetwork and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over\\n170,000.\\nCompetitive Environment\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n9/260\\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery\\nindustries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives,\\nand in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize\\n5\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n10/260\\nthese industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become\\nsubject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of\\nindustries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to\\ndevelop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our\\nofferings includes:\\n•\\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of\\npassenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-\\nhailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility\\noffering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing\\ncompanies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and\\nour Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n•\\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various\\nregions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood,\\nDelivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery\\nservices, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\\n•\\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality\\nLogistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state,\\nlocal and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection,\\nintellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network\\ncompanies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied,\\ncreated, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described\\nbelow.\\nMobility\\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations\\nin the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative\\nbodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating\\nour Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States,\\ncertain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and\\nregulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea,\\nand Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain\\nridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model.\\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted\\nTransportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations.\\xa0These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile\\napps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.\\xa0 These\\nregulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible\\nvehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For\\nexample, California’s Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is\\nan employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los\\nAngeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary\\ndamages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a\\npreliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,\\nthe parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition\\n22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition\\n22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under\\nCalifornia law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled\\n“Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements\\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n11/260\\n6\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n12/260\\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:\\n•\\nIn London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at\\nrenewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with respect\\nto confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster\\nMagistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a\\nfit and proper person.\\n•\\nSince April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations\\nimplementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and,\\neffective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City\\nobtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection, we\\nobtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative\\nimpact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to\\noperate in Mexico City.\\n•\\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating\\nminimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi\\nproduct.\\n•\\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing\\nproducts), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December\\n2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers\\nproviding for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. As another example, in\\nOctober 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went\\ninto effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would\\nimplement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our\\nplatform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United\\nStates.\\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory\\nenvironment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.\\nAs we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility\\nproducts.\\nData Privacy and Protection\\nOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and,\\nas a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve\\nplatform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection,\\nuse, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to\\nindividuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have\\nsignificant implications for our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went\\ninto effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and\\nthe California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and\\ndata privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, and foreign regulators are expected to continue\\nproposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to\\nindividuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020 (effective in January 2023), and\\na draft data protection bill pending in India.\\nPayments and Financial Services\\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary\\nin the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment\\nactivities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects\\nof our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition,\\nlaws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide\\npayment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other\\njurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\\nAntitrust\\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of\\ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n13/260\\n7\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n14/260\\nthe EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.\\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we\\nplan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or\\nrequire us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our\\npricing models.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which\\nwe operate. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code,\\nfirmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets,\\ninventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual\\nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess\\nand when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention\\nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information\\nin a commercially prudent manner.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully\\ndepends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We continue to\\ndevelop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and\\ndevelopment (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nSeasonality\\nMobility\\nWe typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and\\nbusiness demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our\\nplatform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in\\nMobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions,\\nwhich altered typical travel patterns. We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as recovery from the\\npandemic continues.\\nDelivery\\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third\\nquarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various\\ndining restrictions.\\nHuman Capital at Uber\\nEmployees\\nWe are a global company and as of December\\xa031, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 29,300 employees globally and\\noperations in approximately 72 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed\\nand managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of\\nDirectors.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other\\npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our\\ncompetitors.\\nAdapting to a New Way of Working. In 2021, the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our\\nemployees and our workforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020,\\nwe asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the\\ndynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans—although many of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated\\nreturn to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of\\nmany of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among\\ncaregivers of young children. To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways\\nto support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives. We provided\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n15/260\\n8\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n16/260\\nmore attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-\\nbeing.\\nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find\\na sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the\\nculture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that\\nmeasures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by\\nlaunching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results of these regular checks to better\\nunderstand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and\\ngrowth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home\\npost-pandemic, was created based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our\\nworkforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as\\nwell as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\\nEmployee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged,\\nsatisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch\\nassignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal\\njobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the\\nbusiness. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote wellness and\\nproductivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life’s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers competitive\\nbenefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique\\npopulations.\\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and\\ncontinued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A\\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our 2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The information\\nin the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.\\nDiversity and Inclusion\\nWe believe that great minds don’t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and\\nvalued. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when\\nemployees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To\\nachieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress. For example,\\nthe Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with\\ndisabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership roles come\\nfrom historically underrepresented groups.\\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics\\ninto the compensation packages of our most senior executives.\\nWe encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager,\\nUber’s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.\\nAs a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically,\\neconomically, or socially. To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create\\nopportunities for all, both inside and outside our company. In July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist\\ncompany and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward. Some of our commitments to anti-racism include:\\n•\\nRidding our platform of racism\\n•\\nFighting racism with technology\\n•\\nSustaining equity and belonging for all\\n•\\nDriving equity in the community\\nFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021\\nESG Report, which are available on our website. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.\\nDriver and Courier Well-Being\\nIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers,\\nMerchants, shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.\\nIn relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world,\\nproviding accessible, flexible work in approximately 72 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n17/260\\n9\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n18/260\\nthrough its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed\\nschedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is\\nsomething we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global\\ndriver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and\\nhas enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be\\ndone to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and\\ncities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current\\nbinary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided\\nsignificant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we\\nbelieve that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has\\nfound innovative ways to address these issues.\\n•\\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.\\nWe believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety\\nnet. This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without\\ncompromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while\\nexpanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\\n◦\\nIn the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent\\nwork, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to\\nplatform work—one where having access to protections and benefits doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job\\ncreation.\\n◦\\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies\\nlike Uber to provide benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and\\nimplemented its requirements.\\n◦\\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections\\ngoing forward. Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National\\nLiving Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible.\\nWe have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise\\nthe standard of flexible work across the industry.\\n•\\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent\\nworkers, including implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of\\nProposition 22.\\n•\\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save\\non costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is\\nhighest).\\n•\\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over\\n100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our\\npartnership with Arizona State University, over 4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate\\ndegree program.\\n•\\nEngagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our\\nplatform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the\\nworld, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world,\\nwe hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our support\\nservices, and other matters.\\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers,\\nmerchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform\\nusers, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well\\nour 2021 ESG Report and our 2021 People and Culture Report.

RISK FACTORS\\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should\\ncarefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including\\nthe sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects\\nand could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or\\nthat we currently do not believe are material.\\nRisk Factor Summary\\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating\\nresults, or prospects.\\n•\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to\\nadversely affect parts of our business.\\n•\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of\\nindependent contractors.\\n•\\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have\\nbeen available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major\\ngeographic region.\\n•\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we\\nhave in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\\n•\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our\\noperating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a\\nresult of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\\n•\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received\\nsignificant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps\\nto rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to\\nsuffer.\\n•\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our\\nefforts to address these challenges may not be successful.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future\\nprospects will be adversely affected.\\n•\\nPlatform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety\\nincidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\\n•\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.\\nThese new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n•\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be\\nnegatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n21/260\\n11\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n22/260\\n•\\nWe may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our\\ncompetitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may\\nbe perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\\n•\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful\\nsuccession planning could adversely affect our business.\\n•\\nWe may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or\\ndestruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\\n•\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\\nbusiness, and operating results.\\n•\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our\\nbusiness may be adversely impacted.\\n•\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and\\ncircumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for\\nimplementing these commitments.\\n•\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain\\nof our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of\\nsuch software, our business would be adversely affected.\\n•\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable\\nterms or at all.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be\\nharmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\n•\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and\\nmay be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future\\nprospects.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial\\nservices.\\n•\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in\\ninvestigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data\\nprotection practices.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the\\nintellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\n•\\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless\\nof our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell\\nyour shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\nGeneral Economic Risks\\nThe coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely impacted and could\\ncontinue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, in an attempt to limit the\\nspread of the virus, various governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions,\\nbusiness restrictions, school closures, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have,\\nan adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally,\\nand affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted and many regions around the world are making\\nprogress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recover to pre-pandemic\\nlevels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints\\nhave been and may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply\\nlevels will return to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the recent surge of COVID-19 primarily related to the rise of the Omicron variant\\nin many markets in the United States and globally has affected and may continue to affect, among other things, travel and result in other\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n23/260\\nCOVID-19 related advisories and restrictions and may adversely affect both Driver supply and consumer demand for our Mobility\\noffering. In addition, certain U.S. jurisdictions have issued emergency orders that require us to cap\\n12\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n24/260\\nfees charged to merchants on Delivery. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering\\nglobally for approximately one year, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\\nFurthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we\\nhave since re-opened certain offices and announced a hybrid return-to-office plan for employees, plans to return to the office may be\\nnegatively impacted by ongoing spread of the COVID-19 virus, including positive tests for COVID-19 among some personnel who\\nvoluntarily returned to the office; these and any future instances of positive COVID-19 tests of personnel working in our offices, as well\\nas continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations, the execution of our business plans,\\nand productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-party service\\nproviders who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices\\nnecessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event\\noccurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our\\nbusiness for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, and\\nour understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in connection\\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to\\nfuture developments.\\nWe have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety\\nrequirements on an expedited basis, particularly those relating to delivery of food and other goods. Our understanding of applicable\\nprivacy, consumer protection and other legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in\\nconnection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in\\nresponse to future developments. In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety\\nrequirements in response to COVID-19 may heighten other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including our classification of\\nDrivers. These challenges could result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or\\noperations.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial\\nresults, which has required and may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions\\nin workforce and certain changes to pricing models of our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving\\nnature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict with precision the\\npandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The\\nextent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\\nduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and\\nwithin the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on\\ncapital and financial markets, the impact on global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that\\nimpact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behaviors, all of which are highly\\nuncertain and cannot be predicted. Moreover, even after shelter at home orders and travel advisories are lifted, demand for our Mobility\\noffering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-\\nCOVID-19 demand levels.\\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and\\nwe may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally,\\nconcerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may\\ncontinue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely\\naffects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk\\nFactors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could\\nadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\\nOperational Risks\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States\\nand abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits,\\ndemands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax\\nauthorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist),\\nrather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose\\nwhether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a\\nvehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or\\nall jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands\\nfor arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n25/260\\n13\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n26/260\\nexpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification\\nclaims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372\\nmillion as of December\\xa031, 2021. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration\\nagreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of\\narbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions\\nregarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees\\nwhere those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective\\nas of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires\\nDrivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the\\ncity attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are\\nmisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged\\nmisclassification of drivers. In August 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft\\nfrom classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, and while the California Court of Appeal\\nsubsequently affirmed the lower court’s ruling, on April 12, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was\\ngranted on April 16, 2021.\\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for\\ndrivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers\\nwill be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to\\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary\\ninjunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the\\neffective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint\\nagainst Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or\\nsimilar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our\\nbusiness model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees,\\nwe would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and\\nhour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions,\\ntaxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these\\nadditional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising\\nprices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an\\nemployment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such\\nreclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business,\\nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al.\\nruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the\\nplaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will\\ntreat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, going forward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will\\nearn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid holiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a\\npension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal\\ndelivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding\\nemployee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social\\nsecurity or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in\\nSeptember 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining\\nagreement.\\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to\\ngroups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a\\nUK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate\\nsignificantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely\\naffected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and\\nthe resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial\\nstatement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical\\naccounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\\nand Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n27/260\\n14\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n28/260\\non Form 10-K.\\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been\\navailable for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic\\nregion. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in\\nwhich we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in\\nthe logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we\\nexpect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within\\neach of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-\\nquality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants\\nhave a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the\\nhighest volume of orders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient\\nservice for hauling shipments.\\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our\\ncompetitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized\\nexpertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings,\\nand as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of\\nour product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers value more highly than ours,\\nwhich would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in,\\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of\\nuse of our platform, and our margins.\\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\\n•\\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of\\npassenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-\\nhailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility\\noffering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other\\nridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,\\nGrab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n•\\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various\\nregions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood,\\nDelivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that\\noffer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\\n•\\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality\\nLogistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions,\\ninnovative products and offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer.\\nFurther, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger\\nDriver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic\\nmarkets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets,\\nbetter localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly\\nand effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards,\\nwhich may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any\\nregulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to\\nobtain such benefits.\\nWe are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business,\\nincluding in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year\\nafter we dispose of all interests in Grab, India with respect to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada,\\nAustralia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May 2023, while none of our minority-\\nowned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain countries in\\nLatin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and\\nAfrica. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in\\nadditional geographic markets. In addition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n29/260\\n15\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n30/260\\nmajority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight\\nbrokerage.\\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions\\nor may consummate them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of\\nacquisitions, we may be required to divest all or part of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such\\nremedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.\\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to\\ncompete effectively would have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have\\nin the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which has\\nadversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance.\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to\\nlower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and\\npromotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total\\namount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or\\nexceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we do not have a\\nleading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts\\nand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and\\nconsumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and\\nour service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on\\npricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will likely in the future be\\nmodified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be\\nsuccessful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in\\nthe application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to\\nsuccessfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.\\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate\\nthat many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large\\nstockholder), have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments\\nin other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along\\nwith other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to\\nlower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants,\\nshippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service\\nfees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in\\nwhich we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us\\nto achieve profitability.\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating\\nexpenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the\\nyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and as of December\\xa031, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion. We will\\nneed to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in\\nmany of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\\nWe may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in\\norder to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,\\nand promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing\\nchannels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more\\nexpensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts\\nto generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us\\nfrom attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall\\nplatform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which\\nmay at times result in a negative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid\\nto Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which\\nwe currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our\\nexpectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of\\nCareem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n31/260\\n16\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n32/260\\nthe United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating\\nresults may not improve, at least in the near term.\\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of\\ncompetition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity\\nin that geographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to\\noffer their services through our platform, or elect to offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of\\nDrivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply\\nconstraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by\\nconcerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we\\nmay need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network\\neffect that we experience in that market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other\\nfreight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform.\\nFurthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to\\nengage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety\\nand supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will\\nbecome less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number\\nof large restaurant groups and other merchants, and this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our\\nsensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other\\nridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a\\nshipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform\\nusers would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having\\nlarger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be\\novercome by smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability\\nto execute operationally may be more important to service quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service quality diminishes\\nor our competitors’ products achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may\\ndiminish our network effect.\\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things,\\ndissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives),\\ndissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support,\\ndissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents\\nand corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar\\npublic health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture\\nhas not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products\\nand offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents,\\nincluding safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected.\\nIf Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other\\ncampaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise\\nattract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business\\nwould suffer.\\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers\\nceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low\\nswitching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including\\npotential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we aim to provide an\\nearnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work, we continue to\\nexperience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to\\nimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users\\nviews as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud,\\nhelp increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or\\nreported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with platform\\nusers or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to\\nDriver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in protests by\\nDrivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n33/260\\nprotests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of\\nplatform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.\\n17\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n34/260\\nAny decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our\\nnetwork and would harm our future operating results.\\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to\\nonboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have\\nbeen allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is\\ninsufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our qualification and\\nbackground check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide rides through our\\nMobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the\\nbackground check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification,\\nscreening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies)\\ncould also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would\\nadversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in certain jurisdictions, and we\\nmay not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\\nfailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain\\nexisting Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant\\nmedia coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate\\nour brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve\\nand deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation,\\ngovernment investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.\\nWe have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and\\nreputation and fueled distrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely\\naffected our brand and reputation, which made it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our\\nproducts and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental\\ninvestigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain\\nmarkets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety\\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any\\nfuture safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include\\ndisclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue to result in positive and negative media\\ncoverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media\\ncoverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our\\nbrand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-\\nowned companies, including Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own\\napps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and\\nreputation.\\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in\\nconnection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to\\nZomato in India, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do\\nnot control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are\\nnot controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents\\nregarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our\\nreputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand,\\nreputation, and consequently, our business.\\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend\\nlargely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace\\npractices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing\\nand public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not\\nbe successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining\\nand enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the\\ncurrent or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our\\nbrand and reputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n35/260\\n18\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n36/260\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a\\nfailure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in\\nthe past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize\\ncompliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values\\nand composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may\\ncontinue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nOur historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked\\ncoordination and knowledge sharing, causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have\\nsince embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts may not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are\\nnot centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated or managed to achieve consistent business objectives\\nacross functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such reorganizations may not be\\nsuccessful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.\\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in\\nworkforce in 2019 and 2020. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any\\nreductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the\\ncomplexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations,\\nsystems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage\\nour growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 29,300 global\\nemployees as of December\\xa031, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number\\nof our employees located outside the United States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to\\ncontinue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting\\nstaff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful\\nin hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and\\nstaff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions\\nin workforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future\\nimplement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs,\\nsuch as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could\\nadversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future and increase\\nthe risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our growth or any\\nreductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise\\nharm our business.\\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated\\nsystem disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the\\ngrowth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and\\nmanagement systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to commit\\nsubstantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting,\\noperational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with respect to our\\nhigh-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response\\nto evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses\\nwith different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future\\noperations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational\\ntechnology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers, platform user satisfaction will be\\nadversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers,\\nshippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our\\noperational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our\\norganizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to\\neffectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive\\nchallenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n37/260\\n19\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n38/260\\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety\\nincidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers may be harmed, which could have an\\nadverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or\\notherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by\\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, and third parties. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for\\nconsumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Although we\\nadminister certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through third-party service\\nproviders, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in\\ncertain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background\\nchecks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the qualification and\\nbackground check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not\\nindependently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from riders and other consumers, as\\nwell as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other\\nthings, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our\\nplatform.\\nIf Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate\\nconduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe,\\nand we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely\\nimpact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals\\nimpersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise engaging in criminal\\nactivity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct\\nwhile using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we\\noperate have high rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America,\\nthere have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery,\\nviolent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents\\noccur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and\\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or\\nrelated to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and\\nfinancial results.\\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are\\ncaused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not\\nactively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third\\nparties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an\\nincrease in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe\\nlevel of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or\\nuneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles\\npredominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by\\ncars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability\\nand general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to\\nindemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs\\nand adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur\\nsignificant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance\\nrisk will grow.\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These\\nnew ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant\\nresources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of\\nCornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to\\ngrocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc., which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace\\nin North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significant resources to develop and\\nexpand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development\\nbudget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our\\nstrategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and\\ntechnologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience.

It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our\\nproducts and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and\\ntechnologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established\\nproducts, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory\\nauthorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from\\nsuccessfully commercializing new products, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our\\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.\\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited\\nexperience, and if we are unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future\\nprospects will be adversely impacted.\\nAs of December\\xa0 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for\\napproximately 78% of all Trips. We have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made,\\nand expect to continue to make, significant investments to expand our international operations and compete with local and other global\\ncompetitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be successful and may negatively affect our operating\\nresults.\\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do\\nnot face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\\n•\\noperational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\\n•\\nthe resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign\\nlanguages and the adaptation of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices,\\nlaws, and regulations;\\n•\\nlaws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment\\nmethods, Internet activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies\\n(such as ridesharing), logistics services, payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social\\nsecurity laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and background checks, licensing regulations, email messaging,\\nprivacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information, ownership of intellectual property,\\nand other activities important to our business;\\n•\\ncompetition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we\\ndo, that have pre-existing relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or\\nregulatory authorities in those markets;\\n•\\ndiffering levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\\n•\\ndiffering levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\\n•\\nexposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\\n•\\nlegal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting\\nfrom unique local laws or a lack of clear legal precedent;\\n•\\ndifficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees\\nmay become part of labor unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges\\nrelating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\\n•\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nmanaging operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\\n•\\nregulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit\\nthose funds to Drivers in the same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n•\\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions\\non the repatriation of earnings;\\n•\\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining\\nadequate internal controls;\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n41/260\\n21\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n42/260\\n•\\ndifficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across\\nmultiple offerings and jurisdictions;\\n•\\nimport and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\\n•\\npolitical, social, and economic instability abroad, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general, and societal crime\\nconditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\\n•\\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results.\\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain\\njurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than\\noperate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety,\\nand not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our competitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a\\nsignificant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime,\\nZomato and Aurora.\\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management\\nteam or board of directors of Didi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the\\nactions taken by the board of directors of Didi and Zomato. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi\\njoint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture,\\nLime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and Aurora,\\nwe do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may\\nmake decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies.\\nAdditionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to\\ncompete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these\\ncompanies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into\\nmarkets in which we operate.\\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results.\\nFurthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have\\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded\\ncompanies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results. These positions\\ncould expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited operating histories\\nin evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited public\\ninformation is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in\\ncountries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign\\ninvestment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death,\\ndisability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s\\noperations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their\\ncompetitive positions. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s\\nNovember 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab,\\nDidi and Zomato, there is currently no public market for any of these securities, and there may be no market in the future if and when we\\ndecide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we\\nbelieve to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment\\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we\\nwould not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the\\nsale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these\\nbusinesses.\\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects\\nwould be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n43/260\\n22\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n44/260\\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a\\nresult of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience\\nseasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other\\nquarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to\\nother quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically\\nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal\\nincreases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of\\nDelivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19\\npandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in\\nplace orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends\\nto become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may\\nbecome more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results\\nmay fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in\\nwhich we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and\\neffectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in\\ngovernmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment\\nplans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expenses and\\ninvestments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in\\nlosses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors\\nmay lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely\\naffect our financial results and future prospects.\\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods,\\nand we expect that they will continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the\\nduration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and our ability to:\\n•\\ngrow supply and demand on our platform;\\n•\\nincrease existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\\n•\\ncontinue to introduce our platform to new markets;\\n•\\nprovide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\\n•\\nexpand our business and increase our market share and category position;\\n•\\ncompete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\\n•\\ndevelop new products, offerings, and technologies;\\n•\\nidentify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand\\nour platform;\\n•\\npenetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\\n•\\nreduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost\\nalternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\\n•\\nmaintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\\n•\\nenter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as\\nArgentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\\n•\\nincrease positive perception of our brand.\\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our\\nDelivery offering stemming from continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening\\nof Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to\\nmaintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may\\nresult in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We expect to continue\\nto incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve\\nprofitability.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n45/260\\n23\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n46/260\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If\\nour operations in large metropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results\\nand future prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the\\nUnited States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas,\\nwhich has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a\\nresult of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory\\nconditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases or other viruses, such as\\nCOVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we\\noperate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns\\nregarding epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas.\\nAn economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In\\naddition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our\\noperating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing\\nlicenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to\\noperate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing\\nproducts), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New\\nYork City implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for\\ndrivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect\\nin February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City\\nand may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in\\nSan Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions\\nsuch as Seattle have passed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in\\npenetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership\\nis lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are\\nunable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market\\nwould be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result\\nof this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers\\nusing our platform to provide trips to and from airports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed\\nand airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19,\\nor other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross\\nBookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that\\nridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned\\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from\\nairports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on\\nour ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting\\nrequirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups\\nof riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of\\nDrivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we\\nhave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our\\nplatform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and\\nwe may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our\\ncompetitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as\\nless safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous\\nvehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business\\nwith Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and\\nAurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n47/260\\n24\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n48/260\\nnetwork. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we\\ncompete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise\\nAutomation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either\\nalone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in\\nthe mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles,\\nand it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous\\nvehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring\\nautonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to\\nbe superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to\\nleverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our\\nprospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics\\nservices, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to\\nconsumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial\\nperformance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened.\\nFailures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the\\ntechnology of our partners, could generate substantial liability for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny,\\nall of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results.\\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture\\nare developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform.\\nIf regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner\\nwe expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with\\nexisting or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could become subject to substantial fines or\\npenalties.\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful\\nsuccession planning could adversely affect our business.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other\\npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our\\ncompetitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past\\nled to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees. Our employees have been working from home for\\nalmost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan, which includes shifting to\\na hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamic\\nnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing\\nattrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there\\nare instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into\\nthe households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we\\nexperienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity\\ncould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase\\nthe likelihood of senior management or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to\\nattract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our\\noperating results and impair our ability to grow.\\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara\\nKhosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.\\nRecently hired executives may view our business differently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make\\nchanges to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus, operations, or business plans. We may not be able to\\nproperly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key\\nemployees to successfully transition into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and\\nattrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our\\nkey personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future\\nhave an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry\\nexperience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future\\nbusiness prospects could be adversely affected.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n49/260\\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract\\nand retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,\\n25\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n50/260\\nretain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase\\ncommensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality\\nmanagement and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and\\noperating results.\\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the\\nfactors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt,\\nreductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and\\nother macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods\\nin which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public\\ntransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may\\nreduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do\\nnot have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic\\nconditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any\\ndecline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our\\nnetwork declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and\\nofferings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers\\nobtaining additional or alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and\\nthereby reduce our network liquidity.\\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased\\nprices of new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and\\ncarriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee\\nbenefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these\\nparties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to\\nseek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing\\nprices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to\\npass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants,\\nshippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\\nIf we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or\\ndestruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our\\nbrand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location\\ninformation, drivers’ license numbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and\\nmerchant bank account information. As such, we are an attractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or\\nmitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration or destruction of, any such data could result in\\nsignificant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, a diminished ability to\\nretain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process\\nsome of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper\\naccess to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.\\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and\\nare often unrecognizable until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate\\npreventative measures. Our servers and platform may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our\\nsecurity measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures may misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or\\npersonal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. In\\naddition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,\\nincluding potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of\\nlitigation and governmental investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the\\nfuture. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal\\ninformation belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n51/260\\n26\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n52/260\\ncode-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded\\nthe personal data of approximately 57\\xa0million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the\\nnames, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other\\ninformation. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries,\\ninvestigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government\\nagencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer,\\ndisclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action,\\nand negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities\\nfor breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant\\nregulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and\\ndrivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches, or\\nif we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business\\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants,\\nshippers, and carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely\\naffected.\\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to\\ninvest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\\ncarriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in\\nCalifornia intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected\\nfares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the\\nindependence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products,\\nofferings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products,\\nofferings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not\\nprovide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may continue to result\\nin, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation\\nof our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do not\\nperceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which\\nwould adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-\\nowned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of\\nour operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may\\nharm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with\\ninternal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned\\naffiliates, that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third\\nparties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number\\nof limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our\\nmetrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use to\\ntrack these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be\\naccurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of\\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For example, we\\nbelieve that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement\\nmeasures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the\\ndata that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our\\noperating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate\\nrepresentations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes\\nin our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may\\nbe significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous\\nregulatory, operational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse\\nregulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle\\nEast, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n53/260\\nfee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries). In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global\\n27\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n54/260\\nGross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The use of cash in\\nconnection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have\\nspecific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to\\ncomply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that\\nwe suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and\\nDelivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks,\\nand other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on\\nDrivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer\\nsignificant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in\\nthe past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created\\nsystems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect,\\ndeposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers.\\nCreating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee these systems will\\nbe effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a variety\\nof rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our\\ncollection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of\\nour contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply\\nwith applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.\\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\\nresults.\\nIn 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance\\nprivileges would significantly limit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card\\nnetwork operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a\\ncomprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help\\nfacilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network operating\\nrules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment\\ncard network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the\\nStandard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test\\ndetermines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and\\nrequire us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no\\nassurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or\\ninterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could\\nimpact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit\\ncard acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card\\nacceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\\nbusiness, and operating results.\\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile\\nand online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal\\nand external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain\\nproprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by\\nplatform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and\\nphishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future.\\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be\\nsufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches\\nof our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data,\\ncompromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our\\nintellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our\\nreputation, business and operating results.\\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate\\nor ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by\\nour employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may\\nattempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n55/260\\nincident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in\\nadverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the\\n28\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n56/260\\nnumber of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such\\nattacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of\\nplatform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such\\nmeasures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example, software bugs or other\\ntechnical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and\\nwe may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the\\nperformance, reliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform\\nusers and certain regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and\\nbrand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\\nOur platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.\\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex.\\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software\\nthat is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our\\nsoftware code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source\\nsoftware that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result\\nin our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the\\navailability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional\\ndefects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our\\nplatform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the\\noperation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any\\nof these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release of new software in the past has\\ninadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or\\nvulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a\\nnegative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable\\nmedia coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other\\nproceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence\\n(“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be\\nflawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could\\nimpair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the\\ndecisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive\\nharm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our\\nbusiness may be adversely impacted.\\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”)\\nand lower carbon business models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the\\nincreasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and\\nelsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and\\nDrivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\\nAdditionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in\\n2023. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge\\nZone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact\\nour ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market,\\nwe may need to increase Driver incentives.\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and\\ncircumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for\\nimplementing these commitments.\\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025,\\nour commitment to net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by\\n2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets environmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are\\ninherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest\\nsignificant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us\\nto revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our\\nclimate commitments is dependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n57/260\\n29\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n58/260\\ninterpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the\\navailability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related\\nto climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse\\nimpact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\nDependencies on Third Parties\\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures\\nthat are not under our control.\\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control.\\nDisruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the\\nbandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability\\nof our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as\\nplatform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’\\nproducts or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications\\noperators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn\\ncause our revenue to significantly decrease.\\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an\\nunanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in\\ndelays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore,\\nforeign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the\\nrouting level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new\\nproducts to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in\\nterritories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our\\nproducts and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such\\nsoftware, our business would be adversely affected.\\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make\\napplications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain\\ntheir current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc.\\nrequires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us\\nsuch permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be\\nadversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our\\nplatform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping\\nfunction that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide\\nthe global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping\\nfunctions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If\\nsuch third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on\\nterms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be\\nrequired to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of\\nwhich would adversely affect our business.\\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we\\ndo not control.\\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-\\nparty applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and\\nAndroid. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not\\ncontrol. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its\\ncompatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third\\nparties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements\\nbecome unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We\\nrely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using\\nour platform, and these third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these\\ncompanies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n59/260\\n30\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n60/260\\ndisrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and\\ngateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay\\nincreased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs\\non to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines\\nand processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures\\nof the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could\\ncause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a\\nresult of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and carriers could be adversely\\naffected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant\\ntime and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any\\ninterruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our\\nbusiness.\\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not\\ncontrol the physical operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These\\nthird-party operations and co-located data centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of\\nvandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications\\nfailures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide complete redundancy of data\\nstorage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service providers to close our co-\\nlocated data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require\\nus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and\\nmay result in the loss of data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our\\nreputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or\\ninterference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Additionally,\\nour co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities have no obligation to\\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities\\non commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with\\nanother co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause\\nDrivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and\\nshippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers\\nbelieve our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,\\nwhich would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to\\npossible litigation.\\nWe use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use\\nthird-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms\\nof the applicable open source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source\\nsoftware, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who\\ndistribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make available all or part of\\nsuch software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor our\\ncompliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a\\ncomplete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of\\nnon-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach\\nof contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a\\ncourt of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of\\nnon-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our\\nproprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial\\nsoftware because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use\\nof open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for\\nhackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code that we\\nmake available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects becomes publicly available, our ability\\nto protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n61/260\\n31\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n62/260\\nwould be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be\\nharmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are\\nsimilar to or better than ours.\\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms\\nor at all.\\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in\\nnew products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our\\nexisting stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges\\nsuperior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future\\ncould contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that\\nmake it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt\\ninstruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain\\nadditional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us\\nwhen required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be\\nsignificantly limited.\\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under\\nsuch indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating\\nour business.\\nAs of December\\xa0 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4\\xa0 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to\\napproximately $238 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of December\\xa031,\\n2021. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt,\\nsecure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of\\nautonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness.\\nSuch payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our\\nability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn\\nlimit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the\\ngeneral economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking\\nadvantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from\\noperations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our\\nindebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure\\nyou when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.\\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our\\nbusiness and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations,\\nmergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future\\ncould involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which\\nmay make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or\\ndivestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to\\nobtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the\\nsection titled “Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative\\nDisclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”\\nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different\\ncompanies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we\\ncurrently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign\\njurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our\\ncompliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.\\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed\\ntaxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could\\nmaterially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as\\n“pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n63/260\\n32\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n64/260\\nare made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made,\\nthe jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or\\nchallenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\\nfinancial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than\\nanticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax\\nrates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands\\' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or\\naccounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax\\nauthorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could\\nhave an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for\\nincome taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for\\nwhich the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial\\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions\\nor tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in\\nthe future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire\\nbusinesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or\\nthat are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of\\nsuch acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could\\nresult in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could\\nadversely affect our financial results.\\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted\\nin 2017, and modified in 2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and\\nregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and\\ntechnical corrections, as well as interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue\\nService (the “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in\\nsome instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as\\na starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future\\nchanges would have on our business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which\\nwe operate could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our\\nfinancial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our\\nstockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential changes in relevant tax,\\naccounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We\\ncould become subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we\\noperate and other governmental bodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that\\nare contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax\\nreturns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries in which we do business or\\nrequire us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding scale of our international\\nbusiness activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December\\xa0 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax\\npurposes of $14.9 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating\\nloss carryforward amounts generated prior to January 1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward\\namounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December\\xa031, 2021, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of\\n$10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our\\nfuture taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income\\ntax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a\\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a\\nthree-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S.\\nfederal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules\\nfor restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent\\nshifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss\\ncarryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could\\npotentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n65/260\\n33\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n66/260\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nBecause we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but\\nreport our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates\\nvary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and\\nliabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the\\nfuture, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate\\nfluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be\\nharmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form\\njoint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire\\ncomplementary companies or technologies, including our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of\\nSK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates, Drizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry\\nfor acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may\\nnot be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable\\ncompetition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and\\nsignificant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such\\nindebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may\\nfinance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our\\nstockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute\\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired\\nbusinesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such\\nacquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with\\ncertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained\\nour data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships\\nwith government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or\\npenalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an\\nacquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\\n•\\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\\n•\\ndisrupting our ongoing business operations;\\n•\\nplatform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;\\n•\\nimplementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\\n•\\nintegrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting\\nrequirements and timelines;\\n•\\nretaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing\\nemployees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs\\nassociated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\\n•\\nmaintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\\n•\\nintegrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\\n•\\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\\n•\\nliability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\\n•\\nlitigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\\n•\\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s\\noperating functions. For example, with respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n67/260\\n34\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n68/260\\npayments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and each company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams\\nwill continue to operate independently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive Officer. Such structures may delay the\\nefficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational\\nharm to the acquired company’s brand.\\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other\\nsimilar laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage\\ncorrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\\nresponsible.\\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these\\ntransactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint\\nventures, or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators,\\nany or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to\\nconsummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may\\nbe required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our\\nridesharing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due\\nprimarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or\\npermits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements or risk revocation. In addition, we may not be\\nable to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we\\nare subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”\\nincluding with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020,\\nWestminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding\\nus a fit and proper person. Two new conditions (which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in\\nrelation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Any inability to operate in markets such as London, as well as\\npublicity concerning adverse judicial or licensing decisions, would adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. We\\ncannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to\\ntake similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019,\\nMexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational\\nrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a\\ncomprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual\\nvehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection, we have an injunction against such operational\\nrequirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with\\nsuch regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our\\nMobility products or to require us to comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which\\ntaxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional\\ngovernment enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021,\\nwe returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission implemented a per-mile\\nand per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since\\nimplementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so\\nin the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including\\ndriver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those\\nenabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In August 2019, New York\\nCity’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruising\\ncap,” intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business\\ndistrict of New York City. Although such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-\\nhire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San\\nFrancisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax\\nwent into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the\\nSeattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1,\\n2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage\\nrequirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or\\nregulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n69/260\\n35\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n70/260\\njurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their\\napplication or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and\\nproceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently\\nconducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant. For\\nexample, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used the Uber app,\\nconcluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further\\nlegal challenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services\\nand negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility\\nproducts in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made\\ncertain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched Mobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the\\nAppeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we\\ncontinue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and\\nregulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny\\nby government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and\\nDrivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such\\njurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, imposed solely on\\nDrivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision as a\\ngesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers’ defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions\\nof dollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers\\nfrom using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by\\nour competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors,\\nincluding obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of\\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to\\nour Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we\\nor Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth\\nwould be adversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future\\nprospects.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject\\nto differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large\\nnumber of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United\\nStates and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and\\nmaterially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing\\nour operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.\\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to\\ncomply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our\\nofferings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and\\nstate laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate,\\nseveral local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our ability\\nto offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business,\\nespecially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws,\\nregulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to\\nLondon’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in\\nthe city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effect in April 2019), we have\\nadded a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully\\ntransition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled\\nby rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing\\nregulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app,\\nwhich we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government\\nauthorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or\\nindefinite basis.\\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n71/260\\n36\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n72/260\\nreferred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.\\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these\\nlegal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners,\\nlocal regulators, local law enforcement, and platform users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff,\\nand putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, competition,\\nadvertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability, discrimination, safety,\\nand employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court of\\nVictoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in\\nparticular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated\\nunlawfully in such regions during such periods. These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and\\ntime consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in financial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties,\\nincarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which could harm our ability to operate\\nour business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and\\noperating results.\\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers\\ncontinue to have access to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to\\nadditional risks distinct from those relating to our other Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless\\ne-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less\\nsophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The occurrence of real or\\nperceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in\\nnegative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if\\nconsumers are injured.\\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of\\ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the\\nEU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.\\nMany of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints\\nhave been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too high (surge pricing) or\\ntoo low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on\\nour business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions,\\ncould result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or\\ncombinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other\\nrestrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or\\nrestrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our\\ncosts or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger\\nactivity, with a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers,\\nacquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust\\nlaws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and\\ngrowth.\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain\\njurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to\\ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and\\nauthorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber\\nPayments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred\\nto in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries\\nwithin the EEA. We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions\\nto optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses\\nrevoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied\\npayment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit business\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n73/260\\n37\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n74/260\\noperations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or\\nother enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is\\nnot clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such\\narrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may block payments to Drivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such\\nregulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments\\nwe make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our\\nplatform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a\\nplatform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in\\nEEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less\\nconvenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could\\ncause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating\\nresults, and prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated\\ndue to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from\\nconsumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received by those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make\\nDriver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition, operating results, and prospects.\\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability\\nto provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example,\\nchanges to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment\\noperations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V.,\\nis directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned\\nor prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective July 1, 2020, we\\ntransitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do\\nso by the European payments regulations.\\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or\\nrequirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money\\ntransmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic\\nintegrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export restrictions. Our business operations, including our\\npayments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Historical or future non-\\ncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,\\nor other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance\\nrequirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent\\nsales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources\\nto comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and\\nimplement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us\\nif our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in the EEA are not\\nadequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our business.\\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General\\n(“AG”) offices and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\\nWe are the subject of DOJ criminal and civil inquiries and investigations, as well as civil enforcement inquiries and investigations by\\nother government agencies, including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad\\nrange of matters, including our business practices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document\\nretention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved the breach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based\\nservice that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future, settle claims related to such matters. For\\nexample, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General\\nof all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million\\nrelated to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through\\n2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC\\nCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling\\napproximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and may continue to lead to, additional costly and\\ntime-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties\\nimposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued\\na proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed\\nin our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n75/260\\n38\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n76/260\\nmillion ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations\\nand enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform\\nusers’ trust, could severely disrupt our business.\\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the\\nUnited States and other countries.\\nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from\\nus and our senior management. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and\\nother sanctions, and could be forced to change our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations\\ncould also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm, and could result in or complicate other inquiries,\\ninvestigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct investigations. Any of these developments could\\nresult in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations,\\ninquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach\\nand the 2016 Breach. These and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international\\nprivacy, data protection, and other laws. Such violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as\\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally,\\nresulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the subject of inquiries from\\ngovernment agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and\\nnot misrepresent how we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which\\nexposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K.,\\nDutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement\\nagreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with the Office of the New York\\nState Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulated\\njudgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved\\npayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and\\nother orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may\\nimpact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations.\\nFor example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data\\nsecurity breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem\\nbecomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security\\nbreach that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance\\nprograms may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our\\npotential liabilities.\\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations\\ndomestically and internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial\\nadditional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The\\nGDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements\\ninclude higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual\\ndata rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and\\npseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data.\\nThe GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal\\ndata, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical\\nbeliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our\\nability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-\\ncompliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines\\nof up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will\\nincrease our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act\\n(“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January\\n2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain\\nCCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and\\nlikely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018,\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n77/260\\nwhich is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional\\nfollow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”)\\n39\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n78/260\\npassed in California in November 2020.\\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating\\nto transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard\\nContract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a\\n2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for\\ntransferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing\\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer\\npersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\\ncondition, and operating results. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government\\nagencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law\\nenforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with\\nprivacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or\\nother jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user\\ndata with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect\\nto maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our\\nrelationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any\\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are\\nunable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect\\nthe manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation\\nand enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may\\nrequire changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may\\nthereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection\\npolicies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights\\ngroups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\\nfound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant\\npenalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted\\nand adversely affected.\\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to\\nmonetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations,\\nand various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors\\nor, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’\\ntips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace\\nculture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal\\nproceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming,\\ncostly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these\\nlegal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to\\nmonetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to\\nstreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes\\nin state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become\\nburdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have\\nbeen the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use\\nof arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of\\nsexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well\\nas conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to\\nbe revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or\\nspecific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time\\ninvolved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n79/260\\n40\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n80/260\\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future\\nbe subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption\\nlaws to which we are subject.\\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We\\nare subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign\\ngovernments, their officials, and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike\\ncontinue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal\\nactivity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of\\nunauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or business\\npartners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our\\ncontrol. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees,\\nconsultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In\\naddition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties,\\nmay not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance\\nrequirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of\\nplatform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the\\nnumber of Drivers using our platform.\\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However,\\nnumerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including\\nmarkets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa,\\nhave adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our\\nsubsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect\\nour ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work,\\nsimilar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for\\nDrivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and\\ngrowth prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use\\nto onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative\\nclass actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991,\\nalleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after\\nindicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017, we settled an investigation by the FTC\\ninto statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In connection with\\nthis matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time\\nconsuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our\\nbusiness practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file\\nadditional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.\\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our\\nbusiness. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to\\npurchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance\\ncoverage, our business could be harmed.\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance\\nsubsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision,\\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries,\\nand in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers,\\nparticularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be\\nable to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate\\nrisks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance\\ncarriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of\\ninsurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the\\ninsurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n81/260\\n41\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n82/260\\ntransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to\\npay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance\\nreserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and\\nother risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While\\nmanagement believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have\\nrequirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have\\na significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have\\nbeen caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual\\nimpersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional\\nofferings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by\\nDrivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by\\nDrivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not\\nresult in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not\\nbe able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or\\nothers using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or\\nactions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance\\nrequirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change\\ninsurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business\\nmay require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us\\nto comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or\\nactions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and\\nnegative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs,\\nand disrupt our business.\\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models,\\nincluding dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain\\njurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all\\nmajor Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first\\nU.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional regulation of our\\npricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the subject\\nof litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and\\nDriver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.\\nIn addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and\\ncaps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain\\njurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the\\nintellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code,\\nfirmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets,\\ninventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our\\nbusiness and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual\\nproperty, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers could devalue our products and\\nofferings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual\\nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess\\nand when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention\\nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information\\nin a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or\\neffective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the\\nfuture will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and\\nuse the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n83/260\\nacquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks,\\nservice marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be compromised by third\\n42\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n84/260\\nparties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further,\\nwe may be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide to enforce\\nour intellectual property rights, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such\\nenforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a\\nruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may\\nhave an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,”\\nseeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents,\\ncopyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of\\nintellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or\\ninfringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights.\\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not\\noperated, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired\\nor in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or\\nthreats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have an interest loses rights to valuable intellectual\\nproperty or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investment may materially\\ndecline.\\nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could\\ndivert our management’s attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject\\nus to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found\\nto be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to\\ncompete effectively in existing or future businesses.\\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees,\\nwhich may increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding,\\nor business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop\\nalternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to\\ncompete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results could harm our\\noperating results.\\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the\\nevolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and\\nchanges in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model\\nand accounting methods could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or\\nin certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may\\nrequire that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.\\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on\\nour business.\\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are\\npermitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being\\ncharacterized as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment\\ncompany business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (including in China),\\nreferred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe that we are not an investment\\ncompany as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an\\ninvestment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with\\nrestrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our\\nability to transact with affiliates, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may\\nbe required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which could\\nhave an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the\\nsale or transfer of such assets.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our\\noperating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations.

Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In\\nthe past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in\\nSeptember 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our\\nofficers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our IPO.\\nSecurities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\\nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to\\ndecline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at\\nor above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a\\nmerger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the\\ntrading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our\\nmanagement that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous.

In addition, under our\\nexisting debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject to certain limitations on our business and operations, including\\nlimitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these and other provisions, see the risk\\nfactor titled “-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment\\nobligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility\\nin operating our business.”\\nSales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\\nSales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might\\noccur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional\\nequity securities. We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common\\nstock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. For example, on December\\xa01, 2020, we\\ncompleted the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70\\xa0million shares of our common stock and equity\\nawards covering approximately 13\\xa0million shares of our common stock. This and any other such issuance, including the issuance of\\nadditional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing\\nstockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the\\noperation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition,\\ncertain of our existing debt instruments include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a\\nreturn on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent\\nenforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between\\nus and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our\\ndirectors, officers, or employees.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive\\nforum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\\n•\\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\\n•\\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General\\nCorporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\\n•\\nany action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\\n•\\nany action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of\\nDelaware; and\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for\\nwhich the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be\\nthe exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent\\nupon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision.

If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and\\nrestated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the\\ndispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\\nGeneral Risk Factors\\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial\\nreporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our\\ncompany and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on,\\namong other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public\\naccounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to\\ndisclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our\\ninternal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with\\nSection 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely\\nfashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we\\ncan prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and testing\\nprocess of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be\\nunable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future,\\nparticularly due to high growth offerings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and\\ntimely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to\\naccurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial\\nreporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our\\ninternal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the\\nmarket price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which\\nour securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the\\ncapital markets.\\nITEM 1B.

PROPERTIES\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, we leased and owned office facilities around the world totaling 10.6 million square feet, including 2.6\\nmillion square feet for our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.\\nWe believe our facilities, which are generally used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate and suitable for our current needs\\nand that should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.\\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the\\nfuture. The most significant of these matters are described below.\\nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 15 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021 contained\\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial\\nreporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations if\\nthey were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities\\nconspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning\\noffenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and\\ndamage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April\\nand October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these\\nallegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe\\nthat, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated\\nfinancial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are\\ncurrently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the\\nordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the\\ncompliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be\\nless protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government\\ninvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is\\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes,\\nhowever, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on\\nmanagement and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\\nITEM 4.

The COVID-19\\npandemic has rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners,\\nas well as our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the\\ndeclaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities’ and states’ declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings,\\nquarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures have, and may continue to have, an\\nadverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides. Furthermore,\\nwe are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may\\ncontinue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we\\nserve and continue to believe we will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on\\nnavigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive\\naction to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic has reduced the demand for our Mobility offering\\nglobally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or\\nexpanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\\nTo comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared\\nrides Mobility offering in most markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have\\nasked that all employees who are able to do so, to work remotely.\\nAs vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than\\ndriver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we\\nannounced that we are increasing investments in driver incentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.\\nWhile we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-\\n19 on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the\\ndisease, the duration of the outbreak, any future waves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and\\nefficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the further\\nimpact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk\\nFactors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nDriver Classification Developments\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States\\nand abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits,\\ndemands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax\\nauthorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist),\\nrather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney\\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\\nSuperior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary\\ndamages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent\\ncontractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the\\ninjunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters\\napproved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.\\nProposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary\\ninjunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the\\neffective date of Proposition 22.\\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition\\n22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior\\nCourt, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an\\nappeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a\\nguaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these\\nchanges will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK\\nEmployment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n97/260\\n49\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n98/260\\ncontractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were\\nworkers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.\\nThe Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing\\nat the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims\\nsettlement process for UK drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have\\nalso filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met\\nthe “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National\\nLiving Wage when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a\\npension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their\\nclassification under UK law.\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.\\nThe pension regulator has confirmed that Uber will be required to pay historic company contributions, but that we are not required to pay\\nthe driver component of historic pension contributions unless we fail to comply in which case the amount equivalent to those\\ncontributions would be payable as a penalty. We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.\\nOur portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22,\\n2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made\\npayments to the drivers who accepted our offers. We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law\\nfirms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their\\nhistoric claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.\\nIn September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective\\nbargaining agreement.\\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where\\nthose statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the\\napplication of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits,\\nsocial security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as\\nDrivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority\\nof the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of operations, financial\\nposition, and cash flows.\\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial\\nposition and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were\\nclassified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 15 – Commitments and\\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data,” and the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n50\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n99/260\\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nConstant Currency \\n(In millions, except percentages)\\n2020\\n2021\\n2020 to 2021 %\\nChange\\n2020 to 2021 % Change\\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) \\n93\\n118\\n27\\xa0%\\nTrips \\n5,025\\n6,368\\n27\\xa0%\\nGross Bookings \\n$\\n57,897\\xa0\\n$\\n90,415\\xa0\\n56\\xa0%\\n53\\xa0%\\nRevenue\\n$\\n11,139\\xa0\\n$\\n17,455\\xa0\\n57\\xa0%\\n54\\xa0%\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. \\n$\\n(6,768)\\n$\\n(496)\\n93\\xa0%\\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n1,169\\xa0\\n$\\n1,596\\xa0\\n37\\xa0%\\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n(873)\\n$\\n(348)\\n60\\xa0%\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\n$\\n(2,528)\\n$\\n(774)\\n69\\xa0%\\n See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most\\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure.\\n See the section titled “Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for more information.\\nMAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. includes stock-based compensation expense of $827 million and $1.2 billion\\nduring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\\nHighlights for 2021\\nOverall Gross Bookings increased by $32.5 billion in 2021, up 56%, or 53% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2020.\\nDelivery Gross Bookings grew 66% from 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket\\nsizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international\\nmarkets. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that\\nare recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.

For additional information, see Note 19 – Divestitures included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements\\nand Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOther Developments\\nMLU B.V. and Uber Russia/CIS Operations\\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the “Framework Agreement”) with Yandex N.V. (“Yandex”) to restructure our\\njoint ventures, MLU B.V. and Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (“SDG”). Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale\\nof our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of our equity interest in MLU B.V. to Yandex during the third quarter of 2021. During the\\nfourth quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, MLU B.V. completed the spin-off of its delivery businesses:\\nYandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery (collectively, “Demerged Businesses”). Immediately following the demerger, Yandex\\nacquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses.

For additional information, see Note\\n1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded\\nthat we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model,\\nrevenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers\\nto Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 – Description of Business and\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and\\nDelivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs\\nincurred for certain Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services\\nprovided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card\\nlosses.\\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the\\nforeseeable future in line with Trip volume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for\\ninsurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located data center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue,\\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n101/260\\n52\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n102/260\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees\\nthat support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community\\nmanagers.

We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as\\nincurred.\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an\\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing\\ncampaigns.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in\\nengineering, design and product development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to\\nthe divestiture of our ATG business in January 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of,\\nexisting products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses\\nas incurred.\\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue\\nto invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other\\nresearch and development programs, offset by a decrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the\\nsale of our ATG Business.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive\\nmanagement and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and\\ncertain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General\\nand administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative\\nexpenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve\\nimproved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network\\nequipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.

As a result, during the\\nyear ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuring and related charges in the consolidated statement of\\noperations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for severance and other\\ntermination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.\\nThese activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original\\nfourth quarter 2020 planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not\\nbelieve these cost-saving measures will impair our ability to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we\\nachieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020 planned cost structure.

For more information about\\nhow we use these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures\\nto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride\\nor received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique\\nconsumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We\\nuse MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries\\nin which we operate.\\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period.\\nFor example, an UberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three\\npassengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\\n60\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n115/260\\nGross Bookings.

In addition to\\nrevenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth\\nrates in constant currency, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We have included these\\xa0non-GAAP\\xa0financial measures\\nbecause they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these\\xa0non-\\nGAAP\\xa0financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the\\nsame manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these\\xa0non-GAAP\\xa0financial measures may differ from\\nsimilarly-titled\\xa0 non-GAAP\\xa0 measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These\\xa0 non-GAAP\\xa0 financial measures should not be\\nconsidered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii)\\nnet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii)\\xa0provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss)\\nfrom equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-\\nbased compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n116/260\\n61\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n117/260\\nimpairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and\\n(xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for\\nfinancial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers,\\nDriver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to\\nhealthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.\\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team\\nto evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating\\nexpenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and\\nevaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful\\nmeasure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable\\ncharges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding the\\nimpacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the\\ncost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective\\nequipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable\\ndonations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives\\nfrom Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of these response initiatives on our results\\nof operations.\\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\\nTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the\\npandemic, we have announced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers\\npersonally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost\\nof purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others\\nin need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver\\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue. The cost of personal\\nprotective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in\\nneed as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a\\nsubstitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and\\namortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have\\nto be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such\\nreplacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable\\nfuture, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response\\ninitiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective\\nequipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs\\nrelated to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income\\ntaxes;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income;\\nforeign currency exchange gains (losses), net;

The decrease in\\ncash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in our operating lease right-of-use\\nassets, prepaid expenses and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts payable\\nand operating lease liabilities.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in\\nacquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-\\nmarketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases of notes receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment,\\npartially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3 billion, proceeds from the sale of equity method\\ninvestments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in\\npurchases of marketable securities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of\\nproperty and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.4 billion.\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 billion\\xa0for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $1.5 billion\\nof proceeds from issuance of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred\\nstock units, partially offset by $307 million of principal repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the\\nacquisition of Careem (“Careem Notes”) and $226 million principal payments on finance leases.\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion\\xa0for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.6 billion\\nof proceeds from issuance of notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units,\\npartially offset by $891 million of principal repayment on Careem Notes and $527 million of principal repayment on term loan and notes.\\nOther Information\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash\\nheld outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic\\noperations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is\\nsufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of\\ncredit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital\\nrequirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”),\\nand other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances,\\ntake preemptive action to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic\\nremain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic\\'s impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity,\\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nPurchase Commitments\\nWe have non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of\\nbusiness. These amounts are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually\\nobligated. As of December\\xa0 31, 2021, we had $394 million in non-cancelable commitments, with varying expiration terms through\\nDecember\\xa015, 2026.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding\\nand evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it\\nrequires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the\\nestimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are\\nreasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\\nrelated disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various\\nother assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\\nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates\\nwe use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could\\ndiffer from those estimates.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n121/260\\n64\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n122/260\\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in\\nthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 – Description\\nof Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item\\n8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with\\nour Mobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the\\ntransaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.\\nBecause end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users\\nare not our customers.\\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service\\nprovided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-\\nuser and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and\\nMerchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the\\nprincipal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users\\nand change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for\\nthese trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such\\namounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated\\nfinancial statements until collected.\\nDriver Incentives\\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.\\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot\\nreasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services\\nare recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to\\ndetermine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing\\nexpenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired\\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets\\nand liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially\\nwith respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected\\ncash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected\\nfuture growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and\\ndiscount rates.\\nManagement\\'s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and\\nliabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any\\nindefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year\\nfrom the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\\ngoodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\\nEmbedded Derivatives\\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded\\nfeatures are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in\\nshares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features\\nwill have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately\\nfrom the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure\\nthese instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our\\nconsolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n123/260\\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the\\nQualified Initial Public Offering (“QIPO”) conversion option (“QIPO Conversion Option”).

The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring\\nat various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance\\ndate of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as\\nof the valuation date.\\nUpon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of\\ncommon stock. For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders\\' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nInvestments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair\\nvalues and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily\\ndeterminable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from\\nobservable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities\\nare recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value\\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.\\nThis valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level\\xa03 in the fair\\nvalue hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data\\navailable including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the\\ninvestees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by\\nus requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for\\ninvestments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and\\nmarket conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value\\nfor the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are\\nevaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we\\nintend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between\\nthe fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-\\ndown of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to\\ncredit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less\\nthan the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.\\nTo determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the\\nsecurity discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is\\nlimited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated\\nbalance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is\\nrecognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are\\nrecognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to\\nexercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the\\nequity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an\\nadjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis\\ndifferences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears. Equity\\nmethod investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value\\nreflected in earnings.\\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the\\ncarrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential\\nimpairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities,\\nseverity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined\\nto be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for\\nthe difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for investments\\nin privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n125/260\\n66\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n126/260\\nassumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the\\ndetermination of the impairment charges.\\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\\ngoodwill might be impaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets\\nand liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental\\nevaluation of the level at which our segment managers review financial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal,\\nregulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic\\nconditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not\\nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves\\nsignificant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating\\nmargins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the\\ndetermination of appropriate market comparables.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations\\nthat may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate\\namounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be\\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\\ndisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded,\\nand the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures\\naccordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant\\njudgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our\\nassessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future\\nevents.\\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these\\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or\\ncash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially\\nadversely affected.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and\\nliability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make\\nsignificant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible\\nassets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets,\\ncomparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are\\nderived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although\\nwe believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience,\\ninternal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect\\neither the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not\\nthat the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income\\ntaxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved\\nfor our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these\\nreserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these\\nmatters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in\\nthe period in which such determination is made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest\\nand penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities\\nwhich may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and\\nassessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n127/260\\n67\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n128/260\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance\\nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\\nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid\\nlosses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes\\nan amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The\\nestimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In\\naddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which\\nconsider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience\\ndevelops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the\\ncurrent year results of operations.\\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability\\ncaused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience\\nand the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many\\nfactors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that\\nwill ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the\\namount provided.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to\\nemployees, members of our board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to\\nemployees. The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a\\nservice-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains service-based vesting condition as well as performance-based\\nvesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied\\nover four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial and\\noperation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance\\nwith applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be\\nrecognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they occur.\\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on\\nthe grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our\\ncommon stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common\\nstock.\\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as\\nfollows:\\n•\\nExpected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for\\nnon-employees.\\n•\\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\\n•\\nExpected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical\\nstock price volatility of our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases,\\nour common share trading history is shorter than the expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our\\nindustry group.\\n•\\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on\\nour common stock.\\nWe continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation\\nexpense calculation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our\\nestimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements\\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n129/260\\n68\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n130/260\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment\\nrisk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced\\nTerm Loan Facilities. The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost.\\nTherefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase\\nthe amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material\\neffect on our financial results.\\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining\\nrates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would\\nhave decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million as of December\\xa031, 2021.\\nInvestment Risk\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We\\nhad cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December\\xa031,\\n2020 and December\\xa031, 2021, respectively. We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments\\nfor trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would\\nprimarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned,\\nprivately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private\\ncompany stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with\\nreadily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public\\ncompanies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In\\ncertain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of\\ntime after a public offering. As of December\\xa031, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method\\ninvestments.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign\\ncurrencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign\\ncurrency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes\\nin exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency\\nrisk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and\\nwe incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses)\\nrelated to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the\\nentities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi\\njoint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge\\nour foreign currency exchange risk.\\n69\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n131/260\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\\nCompany as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period\\nended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our\\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,\\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChanges in Accounting Principles\\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible\\ninstruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity in 2021 and the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s\\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are\\na public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to\\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to\\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\\nor fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group,\\nInc. (“Drizly”) and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\\n2021 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and\\nTransplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly and Transplace are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total\\nassets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively\\nrepresent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n133/260\\n71\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n134/260\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\\nthe financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are\\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and\\nEnd-Users\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and\\nMerchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery\\nservices, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management\\napplies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.\\nThis determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to\\nDrivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs,\\npromotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to\\ndiscounts and promotions.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery\\nrevenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the\\nsignificant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of\\nincentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor\\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes were\\nappropriately analyzed and presented by management.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on\\nthe consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue\\nrecognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.\\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management’s\\nclassification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver statements, rider\\nreceipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of\\nrevenue and income statement classification.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment\\nexpenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for\\ncase reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of\\nthe ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition,\\nmanagement uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which\\nconsider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and\\nadjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company’s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of\\nDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 billion.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical\\naudit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a\\nhigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial\\nmethods and management’s significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. The audit effort also\\ninvolved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on\\nthe consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n135/260\\nof insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and\\nexpected loss costs.

Developing the independent estimate involved independently\\ndeveloping the loss development patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by\\nmanagement. Testing management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of\\nmanagement’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to loss\\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by\\nmanagement.\\n/s/

INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNote 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nDescription of Business\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San\\nFrancisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product\\nexpertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a\\nvariety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of\\nride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants,\\ngrocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other\\ndelivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are\\ncollectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network,\\ntechnology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing\\ntechnologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle\\nEast, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples in the United States (“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we\\nexercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 16 – Variable\\nInterest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical\\nexperience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing\\nbasis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including\\nthe measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and\\nrelated impairment assessments; impairment of\\xa0goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain\\ndeferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to\\njudgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions\\nand inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment\\nassessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and\\nthe recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting\\nfrom the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees\\' operations and financial\\nperformance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable\\nare potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money\\nmarket funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment\\npolicy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed\\ninsured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not\\nexperienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of\\nfunds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved\\ninsurance claims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to\\ncollect amounts due from end-users. Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of\\nhigh credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our\\noperations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available\\ncash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve\\nmonths from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness\\nincurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n147/260\\n82\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n148/260\\nfinancing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt\\ninstruments.\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted\\nmarket and economic conditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been\\nimplemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and “shelter-at-home” orders, that have had an adverse impact on our\\nbusiness and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our\\nDelivery offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce around the world, it is not\\npossible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations,\\nfinancial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend\\nlargely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States),\\nincluding whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions;\\nthe impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and\\nwhether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be\\npredicted.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds,\\ncommercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased\\nwith an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts\\ncollected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, which are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for\\ncertain insurance policies and also include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or\\ncontractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or\\nestimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents to\\namounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n10,873\\xa0\\n$\\n5,647\\xa0\\n$\\n4,295\\xa0\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current\\n99\\xa0\\n250\\xa0\\n631\\xa0\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current\\n1,095\\xa0\\n1,494\\xa0\\n2,879\\xa0\\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n12,067\\xa0\\n$\\n7,391\\xa0\\n$\\n7,805\\xa0\\nCollateral Held by Insurer\\nCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies (“James River”). These funds, previously held in a\\ntrust account, were withdrawn by James River during the fourth quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies\\n(primarily auto insurance policies) issued to one of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and\\nour subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations\\xa0under the indemnification agreements for these insurance policies as\\nincluded in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collateral held by\\ninsurer on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n149/260\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned\\nfunds, previously presented as collateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the\\nfunds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-current restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance\\nsheet as of December 31, 2021.\\nLegacy Auto Insurance Transfer\\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer\\nReinsurance Agreement (the “LPTA”) with James River effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary\\nreinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment\\nby James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (“Premium”). Subsequent to the LPTA,\\nwe retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection\\nwith the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing\\nhandling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of\\nSeptember 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we\\nrecognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between\\n83\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n150/260\\nthe Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the\\nadverse development on the Transferred Claims.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is\\ncredit card and includes (a) end-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by\\npayment service providers but not yet remitted to us, or (ii) completed shipments where we invoice Freight customers (“Shippers”) and\\npayment has not been received. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by product. The portion\\nof the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities. Refer to Note 10 –\\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.\\nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We record\\nan allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks\\nincluding fraudulent credit card transactions. We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and\\nincremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nWe estimate the allowance based on historical experience,\\xa0 estimated future payments and geographical trends, which are reviewed\\nperiodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card losses were\\n$195 million, $178 million and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is\\ncomputed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\\nProperty and Equipment\\nEstimated Useful Life\\nLand\\nIndefinite\\nBuildings\\n30-45 years\\nSite improvements\\n5-15 years\\nLeased vehicles\\n3-10 years\\nComputer equipment\\n3-5 years\\nFurniture and fixtures\\n3-5 years\\nDockless e-bikes\\n3 years\\nInternal-use software\\n2 years\\nLeased computer equipment\\nShorter of estimated useful life or lease term\\nLeasehold improvements\\nShorter of estimated useful life or lease term\\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts\\nand any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that\\ndo not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding\\ndebt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding,\\nand it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a\\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred\\nprior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. In addition, we\\ncapitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\\nLeased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were\\nreclassified to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte.\\nLtd. (“Waydrive”) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd. (“LCR”), a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in\\nSingapore. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information. When leased vehicles are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost\\nand accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the\\nperiod realized. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\\n84\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n151/260\\nLeases\\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified\\nretrospective transition method and used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the “package of practical\\nexpedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and\\ninitial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for\\nlease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases\\nthat qualify.\\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially\\nall of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in\\nexchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an\\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU\\nassets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of\\nthe future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease\\npayments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable.\\nThe IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would\\npay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.\\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability\\ncalculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.\\nVariable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-\\ncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current\\nliabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest;\\ndepreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2020 and\\n2021, less than 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.\\nAcquisitions\\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business\\nCombinations” (“ASC 805”). The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\\nliabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is\\nrecorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record\\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\\nadjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is\\nallocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the\\nfourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units\\nwhen changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In\\ntesting for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to\\na determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the\\ntotality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\\ncarrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative\\nassessment.\\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair\\nvalue exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of\\na reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount\\nof goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\\nIntangible Assets, Net\\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to\\n18 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-\\nLived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\\n85\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n152/260\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n153/260\\nInvestments\\nEquity Securities\\nAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable\\nequity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value\\nonly upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in\\nthe event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily\\ndeterminable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative. Non-marketable equity\\nsecurities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair\\nvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-\\nmarketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential\\nimpairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the\\nearnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory,\\neconomic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed\\nauction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an\\nimpairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds\\nthe fair value of the investment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nDebt Securities\\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security,\\nand the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value.\\nInvestments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of\\nDecember 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were\\nclassified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other\\ncomprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in\\nearnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those\\nwith maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nCertain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities were included in investments on the\\nconsolidated balance sheet.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\\n(“ASC 326”). We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we\\nevaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value\\nbelow its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the\\nsecurity before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither\\ncondition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a\\ncredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the\\nunderlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-\\nrelated, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the\\namortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and\\nrecognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any\\nremaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in\\nexpected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the\\nallowance for credit loss.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant\\ninfluence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the\\nfair value option is elected. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize\\nthrough the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the\\ninvestees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of equity method investments\\none quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. We\\nevaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n154/260\\n86\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n155/260\\nconsolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in\\nvalue might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or\\ninability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists\\nof several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in\\nrecent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.\\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure the\\nrecoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects\\nthe asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which\\nthe carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\\nmarket participants at the measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value\\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted\\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair\\nvalue hierarchy are set forth below:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLevel\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted\\nprices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\\nindirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel\\xa03\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\\nliabilities.\\nOur primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts\\npayable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The\\nestimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value\\ndue to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-\\nTerm Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These\\nevaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective\\ninformation, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that\\nwe are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is\\nthe party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\\nperformance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be\\nsignificant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the\\ndetermination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for\\nthe investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for\\nfurther information.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of\\nour platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables\\nDrivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively\\nthe “Uber Service”). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the\\nplatform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers\\' use of Freight services.\\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors\\nevolve.\\n87\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n156/260\\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the\\nservice fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to\\nperform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable\\nrights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants\\naccept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers\\nand Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a\\nperformance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the\\nmarketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control\\nthe service provided by Drivers to end-users. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323\\nmillion and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.\\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are\\nresponsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users\\nare our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery\\nservice revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of\\ntime the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million and cost of\\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021, we recognized revenue from end-users of $710 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and\\namortization of $2.4 billion associated with these delivery transactions.\\nIn all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to\\nend-users. As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.\\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We\\nevaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the\\nprincipal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This\\ndetermination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to\\nend-users to the extent they are not customers.\\nFor the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate\\na successful trip or Delivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and\\nMerchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to\\nits transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate\\nservices provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users. As part of our evaluation of\\ncontrol, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible for\\nMobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting\\nthe price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the\\ntransaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.\\nIn the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking\\nMobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers\\nand pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis,\\nrepresenting the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we\\npromise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide delivery services. In these markets,\\nwe are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the\\nservices.\\nMobility\\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect\\nwith Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the\\ndifference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between\\nthe amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services\\nwhile we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n157/260\\nand may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a\\ntrip.\\n88\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n158/260\\nIn addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We\\ngenerally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers\\nincentives, or via online payment methods. As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control\\nwhether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until\\ncollected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from\\nDrivers.\\nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.\\nDelivery\\nWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related\\nservice to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery,\\nalcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by\\nCouriers is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are\\nquoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a\\nvariable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of\\ntime following the completion of a delivery.\\nFreight\\nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.\\n(“Transplace”) during the fourth quarter of 2021, our Freight revenue also includes revenue from transportation management. Refer to\\nNote 18 – Business Combinations for further information on the Transplace acquisition.\\nBrokerage\\nBrokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for our services because we control the service provided\\nto customers. Costs incurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network\\nof independent freight carriers to transport freight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and\\npayment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the\\nShipper\\'s order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. We enter into separate contracts with\\nindependent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of payment by the\\nShipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to transport a Shipper’s freight using our network of\\nindependent freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents\\nour performance over the period of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and\\ndestination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon\\nreceipt of invoice.\\nTransportation Management\\nWe provide an integrated logistics and transportation service, which can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier\\nassignment, load management, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services. Our sole performance\\nobligation in these contracts is the integration of these services to transport the Shipper’s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The\\nmajority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon\\nsatisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costs incurred with carriers for these\\ntransactions are recorded in cost of revenue. In transactions where we do not control the service provided to customers, we recognize\\nrevenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period\\nfrom origin to destination by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination,\\ncontracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of\\nour performance obligation.\\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered\\ninto with a Shipper where we are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper\\'s goods,\\nwe control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper,\\nincluding having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper\\'s specifications. We also have\\npricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers. Accordingly, we are the\\nprincipal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the related\\nrevenue on a net basis. Contracts where we do not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years\\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n159/260\\n89\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n160/260\\nAll Other Revenue\\nE-Bikes and E-Scooters\\nPrior to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New\\nMobility products, which were derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842. New Mobility refers to offerings and products\\nthat provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users\\ncontracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-\\nscooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP\\nDivestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.\\nRefer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.\\nAdvanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs\\xa0Collaboration Revenue\\nIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving\\ntechnology. Under this collaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808,\\nCollaborative Arrangements for recognition and presentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 –\\nNon-Controlling Interests for further information.\\nIncentives to Customers\\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot\\nreasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct\\ngood or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are\\nearned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited\\nuncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as\\ncustomer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements\\nof operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred\\nbecause the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive\\npaid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar\\nservices. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and\\n2021 were immaterial.\\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these\\ntransactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\\nAdvertising Revenue\\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for\\nadvertising on our platform. Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number\\nof clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the amount billed to merchants as we control the advertisement before it is transferred\\nto the end-user.\\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in\\nvarious forms of discounts and promotions and include:\\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a\\nmarket to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer\\nproviding a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts\\nand promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred\\nend-user) to the platform and the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically\\npaid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record\\nthe liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and marketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the\\nreferring end-user.\\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by\\nDrivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.\\nThis also includes any discounts offered under our subscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which\\nenable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides. Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a\\nreduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n161/260\\n90\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n162/260\\nRefunds\\nWe record refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants as a reduction of revenue. Refunds to end-users due to\\nend-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with\\nthe corresponding transaction.\\nOther\\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent\\nwith specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental\\nauthorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\\nPractical Expedients\\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance\\nobligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our\\ncontracts with customers.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of\\nGAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service\\nperiod. We account for\\xa0forfeitures\\xa0when they occur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant\\ndate (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques.\\nService-Based Awards\\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line\\nbasis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.\\nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase\\nplan, the valuation model, typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock\\nprice volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the\\nweighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The\\nrisk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. We\\nestimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our\\nhistorical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the\\nexpected term for non-employees’ options based on the contractual term. U.S. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid\\nand do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\\nPerformance-Based Awards\\nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and\\nwarrants that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these\\nawards generally is satisfied over four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified\\nperformance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the occurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i)\\nthe closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public offering (“IPO”). We record stock-\\nbased compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an accelerated\\nattribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are\\nconsidered probable to be satisfied.\\nPrior to our IPO in May 2019, we had not recognized stock-based compensation expense for awards with performance-based\\nconditions which include a qualifying event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered\\nprobable. Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the\\ngrant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining\\nrequisite service period. Refer to Note 11 – Stockholders\\' Equity for further information on our IPO.\\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the\\ngrant date.\\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as\\ndescribed above for service-based awards.\\n91\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n163/260\\nMarket-Based Awards\\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service\\nconditions, performance-based conditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is\\nsatisfied over four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as\\nthe occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon\\nour achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates\\nvarious assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event,\\nand expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average\\nhistorical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry group. We estimate the expected term based on\\nvarious exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Prior to our\\nIPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and\\nestimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management\\'s expectations at the time of measurement of the award\\'s value.\\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated\\nattribution method over the requisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We\\ndetermine the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit\\nservice-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering\\nperiod. The\\xa0ESPP\\xa0provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately\\nsix months. The ESPP\\xa0allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a\\xa015 percent\\xa0discount on the lower price of\\neither (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under the\\xa0ESPP based\\non a combination of options valued using the\\xa0Black-Scholes\\xa0option-pricing model. In 2019, we determine volatility over an expected\\nterm of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility and our peer\\ngroup. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical\\nvolatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.\\nCommon Stock Fair Value\\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of\\nour\\xa0common\\xa0stock.\\nPrior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we\\nbelieve have extensive business, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of\\ngranting stock-based awards and for calculating stock-based compensation expense. We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations\\nto assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value. These contemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies,\\napproaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of\\nPrivately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities\\nfor the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an\\nuncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any\\nrelated appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition\\nthreshold at the effective date to be recognized.\\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in\\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not\\nexpected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately\\ndepends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within\\nthe carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for\\nrecoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing\\ntemporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including\\nfuture market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a\\nchange in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n164/260\\n92\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n165/260\\nwhich the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected\\nto offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”).\\nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant\\nestimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may\\ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable\\ntransaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from\\na weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the\\nassumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external\\ncomparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or\\nvalidity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\\nExpenses\\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\\n•\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility\\nand Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service\\ncosts, costs incurred for certain Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers\\nfor services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks\\nand other credit card losses.\\n•\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees\\nthat support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and\\ncommunity managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain\\ncorporate costs.\\n•\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and\\nmarketing employees, advertising costs, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and\\nother promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.7 billion for the years\\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided\\nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019,\\n2020 and 2021, respectively.\\n•\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for\\nemployees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs\\ndevelopment expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in January 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing\\nimprovements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs.\\n•\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for\\nexecutive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and\\ncommunications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general\\ncorporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\\n•\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and\\nnetwork equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.\\nRestructuring and Related Charges\\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or\\nconsolidation of facilities are recognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-\\nlived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-\\nof-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an employee is\\nentitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the termination plan\\nto employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a\\nplan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the\\nexpected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine\\nthe type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate\\nthat it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate\\ncontracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred\\nfor the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date. Costs\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n166/260\\nassociated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\\nguidance.\\n93\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n167/260\\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are\\nclassified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each\\nemployee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where\\neach lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative\\nexpenses.\\nForeign Currency\\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’\\nactivities. Monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to\\nthe functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement\\nof operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are\\ntranslated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are\\ntranslated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method\\nrequires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities\\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.\\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider\\nrestricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities\\nbecause holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\\nPrior to conversion to common stock upon our IPO, the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock would have been\\nentitled to dividends in preference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be\\ndistributed to the holders of common stock, restricted common stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the\\nholders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred\\nstock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in our\\nlosses.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance\\nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\\nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss\\nadjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for\\ncase reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of\\nthe ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition,\\nwe use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider\\nfrequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops\\nand new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current\\nyear results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with\\nlonger term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the\\namount provided. All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to\\ninherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited\\nhistorical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and\\ncan be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a\\nresult, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the estimate\\nprovided on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations\\nthat may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate\\namounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be\\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\\ndisclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n168/260\\n94\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n169/260\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded,\\nand the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market\\nprices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for\\ncomparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs.

The price in these transactions\\ngenerally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee.

The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable\\ncompanies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input\\nused in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a\\nhybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model\\ninvolves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.\\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction\\nof the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-\\nterm revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result\\nof the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation\\napproaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.\\nDidi Investment\\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our investment in preferred shares of Didi,\\nwhich was previously accounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, was converted to ordinary shares with a\\nreadily determinable fair value and therefore changed to an investment measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December\\xa031,\\n2021, our Didi investment is classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we\\nrecognized an unrealized loss of $3.0 billion on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nZomato Investment\\nIn July 2021, Zomato Media Private Limited (“Zomato”), in which we held preferred shares that were previously classified as non-\\nmarketable equity securities and accounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, completed its IPO in India.\\nAccordingly, our Zomato investment has been converted to ordinary shares upon the completion of the IPO and is classified as a\\nmarketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities\\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis at December\\xa0 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an\\nunrealized gain of $991 million on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021, the carrying value of the investment was $1.1 billion. Our investment is subject to a lock-up period in which our\\nability to sell is restricted until July 2022.\\nAurora Investment\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As consideration for the sale of our ATG Business to\\nAurora, we received common stock in Aurora. Concurrently, we invested in Aurora’s preferred stock. For further information, refer to\\nNote 19 – Divestitures.\\nWe held one seat on Aurora’s board of directors and had the ability to hold a second seat, which, along with our common and\\npreferred stock ownership (our “Aurora Investments”) generate significant influence. We elected to apply the fair value option to our\\nAurora common stock and preferred stock investments in order to provide consistency of accounting treatment to our Aurora\\nInvestments. The Aurora Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in other income\\n(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nOn November 3, 2021, Aurora completed its planned special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) merger with Reinvent\\nTechnology Partners Y, resulting in Aurora becoming a publicly traded company post combination. Upon the completion of the merger,\\nall of our Aurora Investments converted into shares of the newly issued Class A common stock of the publicly traded company. In\\naddition, our ownership was significantly diluted and we lost the ability to appoint a second seat on Aurora’s board of directors. As a\\nresult, we no longer held significant influence over Aurora.

Upon the completion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab,\\nwhich was previously accounted for as an investment in an available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares,\\nconverted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly traded company. We recorded the fair value of our investment\\nwith changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date of the conversion. Upon the\\nconversion, we released the accumulative pre-tax unrealized gains on the investment of $2.8\\xa0 billion recorded through other\\ncomprehensive income and recognized them as unrealized gains in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of\\noperations for year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to the conversion, we recognized unrealized losses of $1.2 billion on the\\ninvestment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the fair\\nvalue change of the equity security.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, our Grab investment has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair\\nvalue (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\\nThe following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for our\\nGrab investment as of December\\xa031, 2020:\\nFair value method\\nRelative weighting\\nKey unobservable input\\nFinancing transactions\\n100%\\nTransaction price per share\\n$6.16\\nVolatility\\n53%\\nEstimated time to liquidity\\n1.75 years\\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below\\ntheir amortized cost based on an analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab’s publicly-traded competitive peer group and\\nrepresentative stock market indices. These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities.\\nUsing the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab’s latest\\nfinancing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global\\npandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by\\n$230\\xa0million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the\\nremaining $173 million, representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an\\nallowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty about Grab’s ability to repay the redemption\\namount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was considered to be less than the fair value of the\\nsecurities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost was considered to reflect a\\ncredit-related impairment charge.\\nThe fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing\\ntransaction closed by the investee during that quarter.

The 2020 Lime Investments were received as part of the\\ntransaction by which we divested of our JUMP business. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP\\nDivestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. Our investment in Lime Common Stock and representation on Lime’s board of directors\\ngives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime. We elected to apply the fair value option to our Lime Common Stock\\ninvestment and therefore we are applying fair value accounting to all of the 2020 Lime Investments which provides for consistency of\\naccounting treatment. The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in\\nearnings. The fair value of the 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2020 of $134 million was determined by referencing a\\ntransaction in a convertible note that is junior to the Lime Convertible Note and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the\\nOPM were discount rates of 22% and 28%, volatility of 67% and time to liquidity of 2.0 years.\\nIn December 2021, we contributed an additional $50 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a second convertible secured note that\\nmay be converted into common or preferred stock. The fair value of our Lime investments as of December\\xa031, 2021 of $162 million was\\ndetermined by referencing a financing transaction and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of\\n22% and 28%, volatility of 70% and time to liquidity of 1.25 years.\\nFinancial Assets Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of as\\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\\nNon-marketable\\nDebt Securities\\nNon-marketable\\nEquity Securities\\nNotes Receivable\\nMLU B.V.

Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because\\nwe estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (“CSE”) and OPM\\nmethods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the\\nsecurities we hold.\\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments)\\nrecorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of\\nnon-marketable equity securities held during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on the observable price in an\\norderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\nUpward adjustments\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n71\\xa0\\nDownward adjustments (including impairment)\\n—\\xa0\\n(1,690)\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n(1,690)\\n$\\n71\\xa0\\nWe evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that\\nconsiders various potential impairment indicators. This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to, an assessment\\nof a significant adverse change in the economic environment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition of the\\ngeographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other publicly available information that affect the value of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined\\nan impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less\\nthan their carrying value.\\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE\\nmethod along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM\\napproach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.\\nWe computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi’s representative stock market indices\\nand publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the\\nannouncement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered\\nindicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation\\nderived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair\\nvalue of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE\\nallocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment\\ndifferential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to\\naccess to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-\\neconomic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the\\nvaluation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of\\noperations during the first quarter of 2020. There was no remeasurement event for our investment in Didi that occurred during the\\nremainder of 2020.\\nThe following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in\\nDidi as of March 31, 2020:\\nFair value method\\nKey unobservable input\\nCSE\\nMarket adjustment\\n(20)%\\nOPM\\nVolatility\\n39%\\nEstimated time to liquidity\\n2.0 years\\nMarket adjustment\\n(40)%\\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this\\ntransaction.

In\\nexchange for consideration contributed, we received a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting\\nof common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuances of MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to\\napproximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant\\ninfluence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value\\xa0of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows\\nof MLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\\n2020\\nDuring 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (“Drive”) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity\\ninterest. The contribution of Drive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilution of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain\\nrecognized on the dilution of our interest was not material to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31,\\n2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of its autonomous driving unit into a new legal entity,\\nYandex Self Driving Group B.V. (“SDG”), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of our ownership interest to\\n20% in SDG, initially valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.\\n2021\\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the “Framework Agreement”) to restructure our joint ventures,\\nMLU B.V. and SDG and we would sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the\\n“Initial Closing”). Subsequent to the Initial Closing, Yandex spun-off, by way of demerger from MLU B.V., its delivery businesses:\\nYandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery (collectively, “Demerged Businesses”). Immediately following the demerger, Yandex\\nacquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses (“Demerger Share Closing”). In connection with the Framework\\nAgreement, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during the\\ntwo-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash\\nallocated as follows: (i) $276 million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the\\nDemerged Businesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLU B.V. Call Option; and (iv) the remaining immaterial amounts to our interest in\\nSDG.\\nInitial Closing\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in\\nSDG and 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. to Yandex.

As a result, we derecognized our entire equity\\ninterest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized a gain of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement\\nof operations.\\nMLU B.V. Call Option\\nThe MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet,\\ninitially valued at $230 million and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.8\\nbillion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the option exercise. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU\\nB.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which\\nsimulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to\\nthe lattice model were underlying business value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price\\n(Level 3).\\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment\\nand our proportionate share of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for\\nour share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net\\nof accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional\\ncurrency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.\\nThe table below provides the composition of the basis difference as of December\\xa031, 2021 (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2021\\nEquity method goodwill\\n$\\n545\\xa0\\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\\n54\\xa0\\nDeferred tax liabilities\\n(12)\\nCumulative currency translation adjustments\\n(107)\\nBasis difference\\n$\\n480\\xa0\\nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the\\ndifference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equity method goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance is reviewed for impairment\\nwhenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and\\n2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The future effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and\\nrelated government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.\\nMission Bay 3 & 4\\nThe Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (“ECOP”), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber\\nand two companies (“LLC Partners”) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-\\nowned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 million cash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and\\n10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\\nIn March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were\\nused to first pay off the existing construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and\\nlast, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to Uber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber\\nreceived $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and reduced the investment carrying value by the same amount.\\nWe have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting\\nperiod and a quarter in arrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP’s income or\\nloss, and any impairments, with a corresponding credit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax\\nin the consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the construction was completed and leasing activities commenced. and\\nimmaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized during 2019, 2020 and 2021. During 2020 and 2021, we incurred an immaterial\\namount of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no\\nimpairment of our investment in ECOP.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n184/260\\n104\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n185/260\\nNote 5 – Property and Equipment, Net\\nThe components of property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\nLand\\n$\\n66\\xa0\\n$\\n65\\xa0\\nBuilding and site improvements\\n711\\xa0\\n737\\xa0\\nLeasehold improvements\\n435\\xa0\\n594\\xa0\\nComputer equipment\\n560\\xa0\\n468\\xa0\\nLeased computer equipment\\n596\\xa0\\n650\\xa0\\nLeased vehicles\\n6\\xa0\\n7\\xa0\\nInternal-use software\\n203\\xa0\\n258\\xa0\\nFurniture and fixtures\\n83\\xa0\\n99\\xa0\\nDockless e-bikes\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nConstruction in progress\\n170\\xa0\\n157\\xa0\\nTotal\\n2,830\\xa0\\n3,035\\xa0\\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization\\n(1,016)\\n(1,182)\\nProperty and equipment, net\\n$\\n1,814\\xa0\\n$\\n1,853\\xa0\\nWe capitalized $76 million and $55 million in internal-use software costs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,\\nrespectively, which is included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

As a\\nresult, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying\\nvalue. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companies that have comparable businesses\\nwhich is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, a\\ngoodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of\\noperations after consideration of impairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit.

The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events\\nbut will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.\\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a\\ncombination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.

The difference of $243 million between the principal\\namount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the\\neffective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included\\nin additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet\\nthe conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the\\npricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\\nEffective January\\xa01, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard\\nresulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At\\nadoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January\\xa01, 2021\\ninterest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December\\xa031, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices\\nin markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\nSenior Notes\\nIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November\\xa01, 2023 (the “2023\\nSenior Notes”) and eight-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November\\xa01, 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”)\\nin a private placement offering totaling $2.0 billion.

Upon\\nour IPO, we recognized $3.6 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Upon the IPO, shares were issued to satisfy the vesting of\\nRSUs with a performance condition. To meet the related tax withholding requirements, we withheld 29 million of the 76 million shares of\\ncommon stock issued. Based on the IPO public offering price of $45.00 per share, the tax withholding obligation was $1.3 billion.\\nAs a result of\\xa0stock-based compensation expense\\xa0for vested and unvested RSUs upon the IPO, we recorded an additional deferred tax\\nasset of\\xa0approximately\\xa0$1.1 billion that was offset by a full valuation allowance.\\nPayPal, Inc.

The redomiciliation resulted in a step-up in the tax\\nbasis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a\\nreserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for “Change in unrecognized tax benefits”).\\nBased on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreign\\ndeferred tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, were offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to\\nthe 2019 rate impact for “Valuation allowance”) to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain tax positions.

The current year tax\\nexpense and any subsequent changes in the recognition or measurement of this deferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing\\noperations.\\nBased on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-\\nmaterial jurisdictions’ deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against\\nnet deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future\\ntaxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction.\\nOur judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to\\nsuccessfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation\\nallowance against net deferred tax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the\\nincrease in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state\\nand Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by\\nthe release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source\\nof taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be\\nconsidered as support for realization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for\\ndeferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our\\nU.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source of income.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $3.2 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $11.7 billion that\\nhave an unlimited carryover period.

The most recent analysis of our historical\\nownership changes was completed through December\\xa031, 2021. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax\\nattributes.\\nThe following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$\\n394\\xa0\\n$\\n1,797\\xa0\\n$\\n2,293\\xa0\\nGross increases - current year tax positions\\n1,566\\xa0\\n353\\xa0\\n239\\xa0\\nGross increases - prior year tax positions\\n16\\xa0\\n191\\xa0\\n134\\xa0\\nGross decreases - prior year tax positions\\n(36)\\n(48)\\n(9)\\nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities\\n(143)\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$\\n1,797\\xa0\\n$\\n2,293\\xa0\\n$\\n2,657\\xa0\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, approximately $204 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax\\nrate. The remaining $2.5 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance\\nagainst certain deferred tax assets.\\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $12 million\\nand $18 million, respectively.\\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination\\nand the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December\\xa031, 2021 that are reasonably possible to\\noccur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign\\nincome tax examinations. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute\\ncarryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign\\ntax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021, the open tax years for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows:\\nJurisdiction\\nTax Years\\nU.S. Federal\\n2011 - 2021\\nU.S. States\\n2004 - 2021\\nBrazil\\n2016 - 2021\\nNetherlands\\n2018 - 2021\\nAustralia\\n2017 - 2021\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the amount of accumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely\\nreinvest is not material.\\nNote 13 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares\\noutstanding for the periods presented.

As of\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion\\nand $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters, respectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets\\nfor all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among\\nothers, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check\\nviolations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other\\nemployment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims,\\ndata and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters. We have existing litigation,\\nincluding class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings,\\nasserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of\\nCalifornia State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions -\\nan increased number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current\\nknowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have\\na material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is\\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in\\nexcess of management\\'s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\\nDriver Classification\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The\\ntest is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v.\\nSuperior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring\\nentity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual\\ncourse of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the\\nhiring entity.\\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San\\nDiego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are\\nmisclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged\\nmisclassification of drivers.\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent\\ncontractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of\\nAppeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The\\npetition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal\\nopinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as\\nindependent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n218/260\\n127\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n219/260\\nunder California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into\\neffect on December 16, 2020.\\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court\\nfollowing the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a\\nstipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with the trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the\\nstipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the California\\nAttorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matter pending coordination with other\\nCalifornia employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. We intend to continue to vigorously\\ndefend ourselves. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be\\nestimated.\\nIn addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that\\nProposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California\\nSuperior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21,\\n2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and\\nServices organization has also filed an appeal.\\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The\\ncomplaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July\\n20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary\\njudgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in which we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted\\nour motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any\\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\\nSwiss Social Security Reclassification\\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier\\nOperations B.V. or of Uber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security\\nand Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security\\ncontributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January\\n2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber BV and\\nRasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact\\non our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount\\naccrued for this matter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal\\nagainst us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in\\nthe UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is\\nswitched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our\\nappeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in\\nJuly 2020.\\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers\\nfor UK employment law purposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and\\nquantified at a future hearing in July 2022.\\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the\\nNational Living Wage when driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically\\nenrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims\\nrelating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national\\nminimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already\\nrepresented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in\\n2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to\\nworking time, expenses, and holiday pay.\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.\\nWe have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is\\nuncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these matters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as\\nof December\\xa031, 2021.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n220/260\\n128\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n221/260\\nOther Driver Classification Matters\\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims,\\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of\\nDrivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is supported\\nby the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are\\ninherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on\\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these\\nmatters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of\\nmanagement resources and other factors.\\nState Unemployment Taxes\\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors\\nor employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL\\nmade an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15,\\n2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided\\nseveral assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment\\nand are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain,\\nwe recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2021.\\nGoogle v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of\\nGoogle, alleging breach of their respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting\\nGoogle employees and starting a new venture to compete with Google’s business in contravention of their respective employment\\nagreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March 26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel\\nissued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million against Anthony Levandowski\\nand $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On\\nFebruary 7, 2020, Ron and Google entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the\\namount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues\\nto exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski. Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for\\nindemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement. In March 2020,\\nLevandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski\\nfrom the trade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim\\nagainst Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and\\nLevandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that is scheduled for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022.\\nWhile the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2021.\\nNon-Income Tax Matters\\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and\\nforeign tax authorities with regard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily\\narises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In\\njurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales,\\nvalue added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such Drivers.\\nWe are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a\\ntransportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service\\nfee that we charge Drivers, both retroactively and prospectively. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual\\nDriver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected to consider the U.K. Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021\\nruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC\\nmay update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution after\\nexhausting HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require\\nthe up-front payment to the Tax Court (“pay-to-play”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that\\nwe have meritorious defense in these proceedings.\\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in\\ncertain jurisdictions, therefore, the final outcome could be different from the estimated liability recorded.\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n222/260\\n129\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n223/260\\nOther Legal and Regulatory Matters\\nWe have been subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices,\\ncompliance with antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data\\nprotection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights.\\nWe have investigated many of these matters and we are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and\\ncompliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes\\nand implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and require\\nsignificant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business,\\nreputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities\\nand procedures.\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties.\\nPursuant to these provisions, we may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with\\ntheir activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into\\nindemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incorporation\\nand bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these\\nindemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\\nNote 16 – Variable Interest Entities\\nVIEs are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we\\nhave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate\\nthe assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs.\\nTotal assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $1.2\\nbillion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Total liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31, 2020\\nwere not material and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021.\\nFreight Holding\\nIn July 2018, we created a new majority-owned subsidiary, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”). The purpose of\\nFreight Holding is to perform the business activities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was\\ndetermined to be a variable interest.\\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (“2020 Freight Series A Preferred\\nStock Purchase Agreement”) with outside investor (“2020 Freight Series A Investor”) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (“Freight\\nSeries A”).\\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public\\nInvestment Fund, which is an investor in Uber.\\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (“2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase\\nAgreement”) with outside investors (“Freight Series A-1 Investors”) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight\\nHolding (“Freight Series A-1”). Neither the Freight Series A or Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that Freight\\nHolding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we continue to own the majority of the issued and outstanding capital\\nstock of Freight Holding and report non-controlling interest as further described in Note 17 – Non-Controlling Interests.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments\\nIn April 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle\\ntechnologies (excluding liabilities arising from certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any\\nremediation costs associated with certain obligations that may arise as a result of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for\\ncommon units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate. Subsequent to the formation of Apparate, Apparate entered into a Class\\nA Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (“Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement”) with SVF Yellow (USA) Corporation (“SoftBank”), Toyota\\nMotor North America, Inc. (“Toyota”), and DENSO International America, Inc. (“DENSO”). Preferred units were issued in July 2019 to\\nSoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO and provided the investors with an aggregate 13.8% initial ownership interest in Apparate on an as-\\nconverted basis. The common units held by us in Apparate were determined to be a variable interest.

On\\nJanuary 19, 2021, we completed the sale of the ATG Business to Aurora. Refer to the section titled “Unconsolidated VIEs” below for\\nadditional information on Aurora. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information on the sale of the ATG Business.\\nCareem Qatar and Morocco\\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant\\nto an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) in countries where regulatory approval was obtained or which did not\\nrequire regulatory approval. The assets and operations in Qatar and Morocco (collectively “Non-Transferred Countries”) had not yet been\\ntransferred to us as of December 31, 2020. The purpose of the Careem Qatar and Morocco’s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing\\nservices in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-Transferred Countries were not transferred as of\\nDecember 31, 2020, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries which was considered\\na variable interest. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through the\\nright to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer upon regulatory approval of the entities comprising the\\nNon-Transferred Countries. We controlled Intellectual Properties (“IP”) which are significant for the business of Non-Transferred\\nCountries and sub-license those IP to the Non-Transferred Countries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the\\ndefinition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries. As a result, we\\nconsolidated the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries as of December 31, 2020.\\nOn September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem’s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. Transfer of the assets and\\noperations of Careem Qatar will be subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval. We have rights to all residual\\ninterests in the Careem Qatar entity which is considered a variable interest. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem\\nQatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of\\nthe Careem Qatar entity. As a result, we consolidated Careem Qatar as of December 31, 2021.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to\\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Our carrying amount of assets recognized on the\\nconsolidated balance sheets related to unconsolidated VIEs were $308 million and $598 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021,\\nrespectively, and represents our maximum exposure to loss associated with the unconsolidated VIEs.\\nZomato\\nZomato is incorporated in India with the purposes of providing food delivery services. On January 21, 2020, we acquired\\ncompulsorily convertible cumulative preference shares (“CCPS Preferred Shares”) of Zomato valued at $171 million in exchange for\\nUber’s food delivery operations in India (“Uber Eats India”), and a note receivable valued at $35 million for reimbursement of goods and\\nservices tax. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in the CCPS Preferred Shares of Zomato represented 9.99% of the voting capital\\nupon conversion to ordinary shares. Zomato was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated\\nfinancial support. We were exposed to Zomato’s economic risks and rewards through our investment and note receivable which represent\\nvariable interests, and the carrying values of these variable interests reflect our maximum exposure to loss. However, we were not the\\nprimary beneficiary because neither the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct\\nthe activities that most significantly impact Zomato’s economic performance. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information\\nregarding Zomato and the divestiture of Uber Eats India.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the outstanding note receivable was paid. During the third quarter of 2021, we determined\\nZomato is no longer a VIE as it is sufficiently capitalized as a result of its IPO in India during July 2021.

We were exposed to CS-Mexico’s economic risks and rewards through: the CS-Mexico Put/Call; an immaterial\\nunsecured note; the contractual rights to 35% of contingent sale proceeds from CS-Mexico under certain conditions; and a market-based\\nfee related to the transition services agreement, all of which represented variable interests held by Uber. However, we were not the\\nprimary beneficiary and we did not consolidate CS-Mexico.\\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico’s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction.

We owned 55% of CS-Mexico through our\\nownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico by CS-Global triggered a reconsideration event and we reevaluated if CS-Mexico\\nstill met the definition of a VIE. As of December 31, 2021, we determined that CS-Mexico was no longer a VIE when it was acquired by\\nCS-Global, which has sufficient equity to operate without the need for subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 18 – Business\\nCombinations for further information.\\nAurora\\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. After the sale, we hold equity interests in Aurora through our Aurora\\nInvestments.

Refer Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information regarding the accounting for our\\nAurora Investments and Note 19 – Divestitures for additional information regarding the sale of our ATG Business.\\nAfter the sale in January 2021, we initially determined Aurora was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without\\nfuture subordinated financial support. We were exposed to Aurora’s economic risks and rewards through our equity interests, which\\nrepresented variable interests. On November 3, 2021, Aurora completed its planned SPAC merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y,\\nmaking Aurora a publicly traded company post combination, which triggered a reconsideration event. We reevaluated if Aurora still met\\nthe definition of a VIE and determined that Aurora was no longer a VIE when it completed its SPAC merger given it had sufficient equity\\nto operate without the need for subordinated financial support.\\nMoove\\nOn February 12, 2021 (the “Moove Closing Date”), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment Investments\\nS.L. dba Moove (“Moove”), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, in which Uber\\nacquired a 30% minority interest in Moove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on\\nfuture performance of Moove and certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a term loan of $213\\nmillion to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial partnership agreement. Also included in the agreements is an option for us\\nto purchase common stock of Moove at fair value, beginning two years after the Moove Close Date. After this series of agreements,\\nMoove is considered a related party.\\nOur equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is accounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities\\nincluded in investments on the consolidated balance sheet. The term loan, $204 million as of December 31, 2021, is accounted for as a\\nloan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 – Investments\\nand Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis, for additional information regarding our non-\\nmarketable equity securities.\\nMoove is a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated financial support.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the amounts of non-controlling interests represented\\nby subsidiaries’ preferred units and preferred stock were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.\\nATG Investment: Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement\\nIn July 2019, we closed a Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO (collectively “the Investors”) for\\npurchase by the Investors of Class A Preferred Units (“Preferred Units”) in Apparate. Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million\\nPreferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors for an aggregate consideration of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million\\nfrom SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, the Preferred Units represented an aggregate 14.2%\\nownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining 85.8% ownership interest.\\nSoftBank and Toyota are our existing investors.\\nAt the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but\\nsubject to potential adjustment, as defined by the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement at any time. The Preferred Units are entitled to\\ncertain distributions, including primarily dividends which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate\\'s discretion), and accrue quarterly,\\ncompounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate. The Preferred Units are entitled to distributions upon the occurrence of\\na sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but\\nunpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately prior to the sale or\\nliquidation event. The quarterly dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Apparate’s net income (if applicable), are included\\nin net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units\\ndo not participate in net losses due to a liquidation preference.\\nSoftBank’s Preferred Units\\nBeginning on July 2, 2026, SoftBank has the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at\\na price equal to the number of SoftBank’s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but\\nunpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value of the Preferred Units at the time of conversion (the “Put/Call Price”). Beginning on July 2,\\n2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held by SoftBank at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all,\\nor a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied in cash. The put and call were determined to\\nbe embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detached from the\\nSoftBank Preferred Units.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated\\nfinancial statements and reported at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of\\nSoftBank’s Preferred Units was determined based on a hybrid method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This\\nmethod used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equal probability of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit\\nevent. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of 42%, time to liquidity of 5\\nyears, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from the\\nhybrid method at issuance to evidence that the issuance price of the Preferred Units approximated their fair value. There was no fair value\\nadjustment to SoftBank’s\\xa0redeemable non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nToyota and DENSO’s Preferred Units\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as\\nthese units were not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\\nATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\\nIn conjunction with the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement discussed above, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration\\nagreement among Toyota, DENSO, and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the “ATG Collaboration\\nAgreement”), which became effective as of the closing of the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement in July 2019. Pursuant to the ATG\\nCollaboration Agreement, Toyota would make cash payments to Apparate up to an aggregate of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual\\ninstallments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for each six-month period were\\ncontingent upon the mutual agreement between the parties on the development activities and milestones to be achieved in the next six\\nmonths and the continuation of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The ATG Collaboration Agreement was within the scope of ASC 808,\\nCollaborative Arrangements. The development activities were considered ongoing and central to the activities of ATG. As a result, the\\namounts received from Toyota were recognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technology\\nPrograms) ratably over the respective six-month service period to which each payment relates, as the related development activities are\\nperformed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42 million and $100 million, respectively, as revenue\\nunder the ATG Collaboration Agreement.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n229/260\\n133\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n230/260\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As a result, our controlling\\ninterest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora. We\\nderecognized the carrying value of non-controlling interests in the ATG Business of $1.1 billion, which included Toyota and DENSO\\nnon-redeemable non-controlling interests of $701 million and Softbank’s redeemable non-controlling interests of $356 million. Refer to\\nNote 19 – Divestitures for further information.\\nFreight Holding\\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we owned 85% and 78%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our\\nsubsidiary Freight Holding, or 79% and 75%, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our\\nFreight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, under the Freight Holding\\nincentive plan, a total number of 99.8 million shares of Freight Holding are reserved. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, 83.8 million\\nand 85.0 million shares, respectively, were available for grant and issuance. The redeemable non-controlling interest of Freight Holding is\\nnot accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.\\nHolders of Common Stock of Freight Holding\\nThe minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including any holders of common equity awards issued under\\nthe employee equity incentive plans and employees who hold fully vested shares, have put rights to sell certain of their equity interests at\\nfair value to us at specified periods of time that terminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the\\nsubsidiary. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied in either cash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock\\nbased upon our election. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the minority common stockholders ownership in Freight Holding is\\nclassified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.\\nWe attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable\\nnon-controlling interests generated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority\\nshareholders of common shares during the period.\\nFreight Series A Preferred Stock\\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight\\nSeries A Investor. Pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor agreed\\nto invest an aggregate of $500 million in Freight Holding, which will occur over a number of closings, subject to customary closing\\nconditions.\\nOn October 6, 2020, the initial closing occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020\\nFreight Series A Investor invested $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock, representing\\napproximately 8% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis.\\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor has the option to purchase additional shares in tranches of at least $50 million at a time at the\\ninitial purchase price for two years following initial closing up to an additional aggregate $250 million. This right to continue to invest at\\nthe initial price over two years is a forward obligation classified as a liability measured at fair value which was initially valued using a\\ntwo-year discount rate and is immaterial. We will maintain majority ownership of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight\\nHolding following such additional investment. Upon the passage of two years from initial close, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor must\\npurchase and Freight Holding must issue any remaining unissued additional shares at the purchase price. The 2020 Freight Series A\\nInvestor holds two seats on the Freight Holding board of directors as of December 31, 2021.\\nWe do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s loss to the redeemable non-controlling interests in Series A Preferred\\nshares of Freight Holding because these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not participate in losses that would\\ncause their interest to be below the liquidation preference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferred stock are entitled to the\\ngreater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation preference on their initial investment, as well as 6% continuously compounding cumulative\\ndividends that will be paid before any distribution to common shareholders or (ii) the fair value of their investment (the “Freight Series A\\nLiquidation Preference”). The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if applicable), are\\nincluded in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock may be called by us at our option after the passage of five years\\nat the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference. Beginning after three years, if a series of events occur including Freight Holding not\\nconsummating an IPO, 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock could become redeemable at the Freight Series\\nA Liquidation Preference upon the passage of five years. Upon redemption, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A\\npreferred stock would be settled in either cash or Uber common shares at our option.\\n134\\n1/30/25, 4:35 PM\\nuber-20211231\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315122000008/uber-20211231.htm\\n231/260\\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding\\'s Series A Preferred\\nStock to The Public Investment Fund, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis at the time\\nof the sale. As of December 31, 2021, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the Public Investment Fund were classified as non-\\nredeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption\\nrights that are outside our control.\\nFreight Series A-1 Preferred Stock\\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Freight Series A-1\\nInvestors. Pursuant to the 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Freight Series A-1 Investors agreed to invest an\\naggregate of $550 million in Freight Holding in exchange for Freight Series A-1 preferred stock. The purchase and sale of the Freight\\nSeries A-1 preferred stock took place concurrently with the closing of the Transplace acquisition. Refer to Note 18 – Business\\nCombinations for additional information on the Transplace acquisition.\\nFreight Series A-1 Investors have basic rights and preferences which primarily include: one vote per share; conversion rights to\\ncommon shares; 6% cumulative dividend preference and liquidation preference (a 1.0x liquidation preference of original issuance price\\nplus cumulative unpaid dividends). The accruing dividends are compounding annually, and are only payable when dividends are declared\\nby Freight Holding’s Board. The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if applicable), are\\nincluded in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations. As of\\nDecember 31, 2021, the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock held by the Freight Series A-1 Investors were classified as non-redeemable\\nnon-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that\\nare outside our control.\\nCornershop\\nOn July 6, 2020, we closed the acquisition of a 55% controlling ownership interest in CS-Global. Refer to Note 18 – Business\\nCombinations for further information. As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable\\nnon-controlling interest because it is subject to a put/call agreement which was not solely in our control to exercise. At each balance sheet\\ndate, the redeemable non-controlling interest was measured using a discounted cash flow methodology and the carrying value was\\nadjusted if the fair value was higher than the carrying value. The initial fair value, as of the acquisition date of July 6, 2020, was $290\\nmillion. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global’s\\xa0redeemable non-controlling interest during the year ended December 31,\\n2020. As of December 31, 2020, Cornershop’s financial results were consolidated in our consolidated financial statements given our\\nmajority ownership interest.\\nOn January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, which\\nincreased the redeemable non-controlling interest. In August 2021, we acquired the minority shareholders\\' interests in CS-Global in an\\nall-stock transaction and CS-Global became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. We derecognized the carrying value of redeemable non-\\ncontrolling interests in CS-Global of $1.3 billion. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.\\nNote 18 – Business Combinations\\nCareem\\nOn January\\xa02, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem. Dubai-based Careem was founded in\\n2012, and provides primarily ridesharing and to a lesser extent meal delivery, and payments services to millions of users in cities across\\nthe Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and advances our strategy\\nof having a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world in which we operate and effect cost and technology\\nsynergies for the rest of Uber’s Mobility business. As of December\\xa031, 2020, ownership of Careem’s operations in Qatar and Morocco\\nhad not yet been transferred to us; however the results of operations and net assets were fully consolidated as variable interest entities.\\nOn September\\xa0 21, 2021, ownership of Careem’s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us.

The significant\\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include discount rates of 5.14% to 5.19% for the principal amount of the Careem\\nNotes and for the conversion option an expected volatility of 42.1% to 44.1%, interest rates of 1.53% to 1.57%, and dividend yield of 0%.\\nWe issued the Careem Notes in different tranches with $880 million of the principal amount of the Careem Notes issued on January\\xa02,\\n2020 and settled in cash on April\\xa01, 2020. Each tranche of the Careem Notes is due and payable 90 days once issued. The holders of the\\nCareem Notes may elect to convert the full outstanding principal balance to Class A common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share\\nof Uber Technologies, Inc. at any time prior to maturity. The discount from the Careem Notes face value to fair value will be accreted\\nthrough the respective repayment dates as interest expense.\\nDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes and as a result of such\\nelections, $539 million of the principal amount of the Careem Notes matured, of which $307 million were settled in cash and $232\\nmillion were settled in equity.\\nThe remaining amount of the Careem Notes is recognized as a commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes at fair value in\\naccrued and other current liabilities of $238 million as of December\\xa031, 2021.

Captains network represents the fair\\nvalue of the underlying network with Careem drivers (called “Captains”). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem’s\\ntechnology. Trade names relate to the “Careem” trade name, trademarks, and domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of\\nthe identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.\\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts\\napproximate their current fair values. We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of,\\nand approximate the amounts a market participant would pay for, these intangible assets as of January\\xa02, 2020.\\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax\\nreserves of certain jurisdictions which reflect potential tax liabilities. We recognized $64 million of indemnification assets on the same\\nbasis as the tax reserves at January\\xa02, 2020, which is recorded as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\\nSettlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnification asset.\\nThe results of the acquired operations were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January\\xa02,\\n2020. For the period from January\\xa0 2, 2020 through December\\xa0 31, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218\\nmillion. Revenue for the period from January\\xa02, 2020 through December\\xa031, 2020 were not material.\\nCornershop\\nIn 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop\\nCayman (“Cornershop”), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial\\ninvestment of $50 million (the “Initial Cornershop Investment”). The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the\\ncountries where Cornershop operates.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended\\nthe terms of the agreement in order for Uber to acquire Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior\\nto the transaction close, Cornershop was restructured such that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its\\nwholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “CS-Mexico”), while all of the remaining Cornershop operations were to be held in\\nthe newly created CS-Global entity.\\nOn July\\xa06, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop’s business operations,\\nexcept for those in Mexico. This transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial\\nCornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a\\ncombination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial Cornershop Investment was remeasured immediately prior to\\nthe acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber’s pre-acquisition ownership percentage, the new\\nvalue was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the\\noriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-\\nGlobal, representing 55% of the outstanding membership interests. As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global\\nand accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop\\nand CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling interest in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right\\nthrough the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the interests in CS-Mexico,\\ncontingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (“CS-Mexico Put/Call”). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-\\nGlobal) or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would\\nmake a direct capital contribution to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55%\\noutstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico.

For the\\nperiod from July\\xa06, 2020 through December 31, 2020, CS-Global contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico’s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January\\xa011,\\n2021, CS-Global exercised the call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity\\ninterest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexico through our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico was\\naccounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial,\\nand consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fair value of the CS-Mexico Put/Call\\nremeasured at the acquisition date. As a result of remeasuring our prior CS-Mexico Put/Call held immediately prior to the business\\ncombination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.\\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop (or 47%, on a fully-diluted\\nbasis) in an all-stock transaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million\\nshares of our common stock, including 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4\\nmillion stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These replacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition\\nservice are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly,\\nwe did not recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection\\nwith this acquisition, the previously recognized non-controlling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop\\nbecame our wholly-owned subsidiary.\\nThe total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber’s share price on the\\nclosing date. The fair value of the 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202\\nmillion. These shares are restricted and contingent on the employees’ continuing employment at the combined company for the next three\\nyears. These restricted shares are considered compensation for post-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based\\ncompensation expense ratably over the next three years.\\nPostmates\\nOn July\\xa05, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand\\ndelivery platform in the U.S.\\nOn December\\xa01, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with\\nPostmates’ distinctive delivery business in the U.S. As a result of the transaction, we obtained ownership interest in Postmates through\\nour voting rights, and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\\ntransferred for Postmates was approximately $3.9 billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nUber common stock transferred\\n$\\n3,494\\xa0\\nNote receivable\\n100\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services\\n308\\xa0\\nTotal consideration\\n$\\n3,902\\xa0\\nThe fair value of the $3.5 billion common stock issued (70 million shares of our common stock), as consideration transferred was\\ndetermined on the basis of the closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date.

Neutron Holdings, Inc. (“Lime”) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-\\nbikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by consumers for personal transportation. We previously held Lime Series C preferred\\nstock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.\\nUber contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP\\nbusiness (collectively, “JUMP Assets”) in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime\\nwere exchanged for common stock (the “Lime Common Stock”), newly issued Lime Series 1-C preferred stock (“Lime 1-C Preferred\\nStock”) and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series 1-C Preferred Stock (“Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants”). Lime Common\\nStock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as of December 31, 2021.\\nConcurrently, we contributed $85\\xa0million of cash to Lime in exchange for a secured note convertible into Lime Series 3 Preferred\\nStock (the “Lime Convertible Note”), which may be converted at any time at our election representing 20% initial ownership in Lime as\\nconverted on a fully-diluted basis. In addition, we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning\\nMay 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of\\nexercise, subject to regulatory approval. We have one seat on Lime’s five-person board of directors. We also amended our preexisting\\ncommercial agreement with Lime.\\nOur ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and\\nthe Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”) and represents approximately 31% on an as converted and fully-\\ndiluted basis as of December 31, 2021. The 2020 Lime Investments are accounted for under the fair value option. Refer to Note 3 -\\nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information. Lime was assessed under the VIE model and considered an\\nunconsolidated VIE. Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\\nThe JUMP Divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that would cause a major effect on our operations and financial results, and\\ntherefore does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. The resulting loss on disposal was\\nnot material to us and was recorded in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter\\nof 2020.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development\\nand commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests\\nin the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third party investors of the ATG Business to settle their\\nATG Series A Stated Liquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-\\ncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as\\nthe only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of\\nfully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora\\nSeries U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\\ndisclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded,\\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and\\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange\\nAct, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief\\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\\nour disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2021 that\\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are\\neffective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\\ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.\\nFurther, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in\\nRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting based on the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our\\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\\xa0 31, 2021. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nIn accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment\\nof internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management’s evaluation of\\ninternal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”), which we acquired\\nin October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”), which we acquired in November 2021, as discussed in Note 18 – Business\\nCombinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results of these in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related to\\nDrizly and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented\\napproximately 3% and 4% of our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December\\xa031, 2021,\\nrespectively.\\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-\\ndemand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and\\nCanada. We have an important purpose, which is to serve and connect. We strive to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to\\nprovide drivers a way to work that gives them control over their time and money.\\nOur ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in\\ncertain cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers\\nrides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of\\nrides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit\\nfrom technological innovation in mobility.\\nOur offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and\\nscooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips.\\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and\\ncommissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings  and Rides  increase, driving more\\nrevenue. We also generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements, the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware, advertising services,\\nriders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our\\nLyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs.\\nRiders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In July 2024, we launched Price\\nLock, a new subscription offering that caps the price of a rider\\'s regular and scheduled rides on a specified route during the rider\\'s chosen pickup time.\\nAdditionally, in February 2024, we launched the driver earnings commitment in limited markets, where we ensure drivers will earn at least 70% of weekly\\npassenger payments after external fees. We then expanded this earnings commitment to all markets in the United States in May 2024. In September 2023, we\\nlaunched Women+ Connect, a new feature that currently offers women and nonbinary riders and drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App\\nto prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders and drivers and in 2024, we extended Women+ Connect nationwide. In November 2024, we\\nannounced plans for multiple AV partnerships that will connect the Lyft community with AV rides in the Lyft app. We are focused on delivering a great\\nrideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time.\\nIn 2024, we achieved net income for the first time in our operating history and record cash flow generation. We are committed to building a durable,\\nhealthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and shareholders.\\nAdditionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Through our Lyft Up initiatives, we’re working\\nto make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We can’t talk about\\nwork that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of\\ncommunities we serve. We’re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more\\nsustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. Over the last two years, we’ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our\\nplatform by investing in EV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging, expanding\\nGreen and advocating for smart EV policy.\\nWe believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand\\nand focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a\\ntransportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\\n For the definition of Gross Bookings and Rides, refer to the “Definitions of Key Metrics” section within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK.\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n5\\nOur Transportation Network\\nOur transportation network is primarily comprised of:\\n•\\nRidesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively\\nincentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer\\nconvenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in\\ncities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other\\nrideshare offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort, Black, Black SUV, and Green.\\n•\\nExpress Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets\\nour requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary,\\nFlexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform.\\n•\\nLight Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are\\nmore active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-\\nmile of a multimodal trip with public transit.\\nDrivers\\nThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between.\\nWe work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity\\nto focus their time on what matters most. Drivers on our platform also have key benefits, which include:\\n•\\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.\\n•\\nTechnology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to\\ndrive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis.\\n•\\nTransparent and Consistent Pay. We\\'ve released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what\\nthey’ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver\\'s pay details, and\\nmade a commitment that drivers will earn 70% or more of rider payment each week, after external fees.\\n•\\nInsurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile\\naccidents while on the platform.\\n•\\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride\\nbooked through the Lyft App.\\n•\\nSupport. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.\\nRiders\\nRiders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and\\nfrom work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated,\\nriders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace, or renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft\\nApp. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, so riders will continue to select Lyft as their transportation\\nnetwork of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include:\\n•\\nSelection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently\\nmatches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability.\\nAdditional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as\\nWomen+ Connect and Price Lock. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most\\nsuitable to their trip.\\n•\\nAvailability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data\\nto help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. Scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time pickup promise in many\\nmajor markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up to the airport, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to make up for it.\\n6\\n•\\nAffordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait &\\nSave, a substantial portion of rides on our platform, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry. In 2024, we launched Price Lock, a\\nnew subscription offering that caps the price of a rider\\'s regular and scheduled rides on a specified route during the rider\\'s chosen pickup time.\\n•\\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative\\nproducts, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, Emergency Help with ADT, Inc. (“ADT”), and partnerships with leading\\nnational organizations to inform our safety policies.\\nBusiness\\nWe work with organizations across a wide range of industries to deliver transportation solutions. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to\\ndesign, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost and streamlining operations.\\nOur Technology Infrastructure and Operations\\nWe organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design.\\nWe focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic.\\nWe seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks\\nin demand.\\nWe have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our\\npartnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 10 “Commitments and\\nContingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this agreement.\\nWe designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full\\nbackups are performed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and\\ncontinuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.\\nOur Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform\\nin real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets\\ncovering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the\\nrides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to\\nbalance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data\\nscience and algorithms to inform our product development.\\nOur Intellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets,\\nlicense agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and\\ninvention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe\\nthat factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger\\ncontributors to our success in the marketplace.\\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous\\nvehicle-related technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. We hold numerous issued and\\npending patents in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual\\nproperty.\\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we seek to register our brand names and product names,\\ntaglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some\\ntrademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.\\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to\\nprotect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information,\\nsee the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other\\nintellectual property rights could harm our business”\\n7\\nand “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.”\\nCompetition\\nThe market for Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”) networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting\\nlevels of demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants\\nin the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these\\ncompetitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth\\nstagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network\\ncompanies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market\\ninclude Lime, Bird, Fifteen, nextbike and Dott. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment,\\nparticularly in markets outside of the United States.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive\\nmanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS\\nofferings that either are competing with us or may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Baidu, Motional, and Tesla as\\nwell as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as\\nfrom new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nWe believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name\\nrecognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly\\ngreater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled\\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely\\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”\\nSeasonality\\nThe revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays.\\nDemand for our transportation network has historically declined over the winter season and demand for our network of Light Vehicles has historically\\nincreased during more temperate and dry seasons.\\nOur Brand and Marketing\\nOur purpose is to serve and connect. The Lyft brand is rooted in expecting more from every journey. Our marketing efforts bring our brand to life\\nacross a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and social media\\nengagement. We also benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider and driver communities.\\nOur marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential\\ndrivers and riders. Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships,\\nand outdoor advertisements. We use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders\\nthrough referrals, partnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We\\ncontinue to engage with current riders through a variety of initiatives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.\\nOur Commitment to Safety\\nA strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with\\ndrivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on improving their safety.\\nTo ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or\\nSCC, team as a key part of our organization. SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels,\\nincluding via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. SCC aims to listen to customers, quickly resolve problems when they occur and\\nmaintain trust with drivers and riders. Some examples of measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include:\\n•\\nAnnual background checks and ongoing criminal monitoring. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered criminal background\\ncheck before they drive and each year after that. In the United States, continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with\\ndisqualifying criminal convictions. Similarly, in the United States, we also\\n8\\ncontinuously check driving records so that we can promptly identify and remove drivers from the platform upon detection of a disqualifying violation.\\n•\\nShare location. The Lyft App provides real-time ride tracking, so riders can share their exact location and route with family and friends. Once a user\\nenables this feature, a user’s trusted contacts (who they shared their location with) can see trip status and where they are on the map.\\n•\\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly\\nconnect with an ADT security professional through the Lyft App, silently or by voice. If someone signals they need help and subsequently does not\\nrespond to a call or text from ADT, ADT will contact 911 and share the user’s location and other relevant information.\\n•\\nLive safety support and specialized support and advocacy. Our Safety team is standing by, ready to help via phone or chat, and every member of the\\nSafety team is a credentialed victim advocate. Each member has training in trauma-informed care.\\n•\\nSmart trip check-in. We monitor rides for certain unusual activity, like long stops or route deviations, and in some instances, if we notice a ride\\nirregularity, we reach out to riders and drivers directly. We will ask the rider or driver if they need help, and, if appropriate, connect them to emergency\\nassistance or our own Safety team.\\n•\\nHidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride.\\nWhile riders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not\\nrevealed. Drivers are also not able to see a rider’s specific drop-off location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\\n•\\nTwo-way ratings and feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or\\ndriver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will\\nnever be matched with that individual again through the app.\\n•\\nIndustry Sharing Safety Program. Lyft partners with certain companies to share information about the drivers who are deactivated from certain\\nrideshare and delivery platforms for specific select reasons. The program enables the sharing of information to equip participating companies with the\\ninformation needed to take action on their own platform.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues\\nsuch as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and\\nworker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, advertising, text messaging, subscription\\nservices, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust,\\narbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing,\\ninsurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety,\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions,\\ntrade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical\\nsupplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As\\na result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by\\nregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact,\\nspecifically relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard”) to\\nmandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional targets intended to reduce GHG emissions from TNC\\nplatforms. Massachusetts, New York City and Toronto are developing or have developed and implemented rules to address the environmental impact of\\nrideshare, and other jurisdictions are likely to consider similar rules and regulations in the future.\\nSee the sections titled “Business” and “Risk Factors” including the subsections titled “Business – Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance -\\nEnvironmental” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to\\nand the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are our human capital and, together with our technology stack, they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2024, we had 2,934 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally in Toronto, Canada,\\nMontreal, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany and Munich, Germany. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or\\ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive.\\n9\\nWe believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the\\nmore our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December\\xa031, 2024, our global\\nemployee base was 58% male and 42% female, and women represented 43% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 46% White,\\n32% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 7% Black, and 6% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our\\nemployee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded\\nfrom the applicable disclosure. As of December\\xa031, 2024, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 3% of total employees, and\\nemployees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% of total U.S. employees.\\nWe strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates,\\ndevelop talent internally, and open up opportunities for career growth. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early\\ncandidate pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2024, we continued\\nour partnerships and outreach programs by directly sourcing candidates from organizations that aim to increase diversity in enterprise hiring pools, such as\\nBreakLine, and DirectEmployers. We also maintained representation in our hiring pool through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion\\ntraining for team members with the Inclusively and Disability:IN organizations.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”)\\nEnvironmental\\nWe have a responsibility to our shared environment — the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. Our environmental impact also\\ngives drivers and riders another great reason to choose Lyft, and is an intrinsic part of how we think about our business goals. We are working to make the Lyft\\nPlatform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes of rideshare and other micromobility options, and\\nbusinesses reduce their carbon footprint.\\nThe rides that we facilitate on our platform make up a significant amount of Lyft’s carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to\\nelectric vehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet.\\nOver 13 million riders rode in an EV in 2024. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars.\\nOver 23% of rides on the Lyft Platform were in a hybrid or an EV. In 2024, we expanded Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle, to 40 airports\\nand 22 cities in North America.\\nBecause we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform. In 2024, we announced a\\ncommitment to invest $80 million by the end of 2025 to support EV drivers and encourage gas powered drivers to make the switch. We are continuing to work\\ntoward our investment goal, and while our timeline may be extended to complete such investment, we expect that the investments we make will help us reach\\n100 million all-time EV rides on the platform by the end of 2025. Most of this investment will benefit drivers in states that are committed to electrifying,\\ndeveloping infrastructure, and growing EV adoption as quickly as possible.\\nWe have enabled growth and adoption of bikeshare in 61 cities across 16 countries where we provide our hardware and software solutions. Working\\nclosely with our city and operating partners in the most complex urban environments, our team enabled 18 major bikeshare system expansions over the past\\nyear through both owned and operated systems and systems that utilize our hardware and software solutions, amounting to nearly 12,000 additional bikes, e-\\nbikes, and e-scooters in cities like Chicago, Portland and New York City in the United States and cities abroad like Barcelona, Monaco, and more.\\nSocial\\nLyft’s purpose is to serve and connect. We strive to get people out into the world so they can live their lives together, and provide drivers a meaningful\\nway to earn that gives them control over their time and money. We’re constantly thinking about the role we play in our customers’ lives.\\nFor riders, social interaction improves physical and mental health. We’re making it easier to get out of the house, and the hundreds of millions of rides\\nwe facilitated in 2024 connected people with friends, family, and coworkers. Everyday encounters like these help people feel happier and more connected to\\ntheir community.\\nFor drivers, Lyft is part of the economic fabric of millions of lives. Drivers may be students putting themselves through college, parents looking for a\\nway to earn while their kids are in school, or seniors interested in meeting new people. The flexibility to work on their own schedules is a core benefit of\\ndriving with Lyft, and millions of drivers use the platform to support their families or build toward their dreams. We keep working to understand who drivers\\nare and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report.\\nWe want to improve the lives of everyone we interact with, but know that targeted programs can have an outsized impact. Through our Lyft Up\\ninitiative, we’re working to provide riders access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their age, income, zip, or postal\\ncode. We provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to people in need. Some of our current Lyft Up\\nprograms assist the community by providing rides to and from\\n10\\njobs, job interviews and trainings, the grocery store for those living in food-insecure areas, and by providing discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily\\ndiscounted electric bikes to income eligible riders. In 2024, we also provided thousands of free rides on Election Day for riders to get to the polls to exercise\\ntheir right to vote. Other Lyft Up programs provide donated ride credits to resettlement agencies and other community based organizations helping refugees\\naccess essential needs and services or relief rides in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters.\\nCorporate Governance\\nOur board of directors regularly evaluates our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies to make sure they fit into our strategy of\\ndriving long-term stockholder value and align with our core values. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be\\nincluded in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in\\n2012 and changed our name to Lyft, Inc. in 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations.\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.lyft.com, and our investor relations website is located at investor.lyft.com.

challenges we may encounter.\\nWhile we have primarily focused on ridesharing since our ridesharing marketplace launched in 2012, our business continues to evolve. We regularly\\nexpand our platform features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. Through the acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (\"PBSC\") in\\nMay 2022, we expanded our business to include licensing of certain of our technology and sales of bikes and stations. In recent periods, we have also\\nreevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused our business model. For example, in February 2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center\\nbusiness. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks\\nand challenges we have faced and expect to face include our ability to:\\n•\\nforecast our gross bookings, revenue and operating results and budget for and manage our expenses;\\n•\\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders, and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\\n•\\neffectively and competitively price our services and determine appropriate pricing methodologies, including in reaction to competitive pressures;\\n•\\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users;\\n•\\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\\n•\\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of economic and other developments, including changes in rider behavior and\\ndemand for our services;\\n•\\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in the\\nExpress Drive program, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\\n•\\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, sell, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles\\nin the Express Drive program;\\n•\\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in market dynamics in the markets in which we operate;\\n•\\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\\n•\\neffectively manage our growth and business operations;\\n•\\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach and manage our international operations;\\n•\\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization; and\\n•\\neffectively manage our real estate footprint.\\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described\\nelsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an\\nevolving financial model and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future gross bookings, revenue, expenses and earnings may not be\\nas accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in\\nthe future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our\\nassumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\\nsuccessfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in\\nthe future.\\nPrior to 2020, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly.\\nAlthough our revenue has since recovered, the timeline for a full recovery of rideshare demand, driver supply and other aspects of our business in each of our\\nmarkets is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to\\nCOVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, may not be indicative of our future performance. Further, we\\nfirst achieved net income, on a GAAP basis, in the year ended December 31, 2024, however, we incurred net losses every other year since our inception, and\\nwe may not be able to achieve or maintain GAAP profitability. We expect that our financial performance, including our net income and Adjusted EBITDA, will\\ncontinue to fluctuate in future periods. We can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis.\\n14\\nWhile we remain focused on operating efficiently, our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform\\nfeatures, expand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement. In addition, certain costs, such as insurance and\\ndriver pay and incentives have increased or fluctuated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic factors and the development and maturation of\\nour business and the rideshare industry, and may continue to do so. We may be unable to accurately predict these costs and our investments may not result in\\nincreased revenue or growth in our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the\\npassage of Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington, and elsewhere, and implementation of operational changes as part of agreements with the\\nNew York and Massachusetts Attorneys General, including providing drivers in these states with new earnings opportunities and protections, including\\ncontributions towards on-the-job injury insurance, other benefits and minimum guaranteed earnings. In addition, various jurisdictions have introduced\\nlegislation setting high earnings standards and increasing other costs to the business including insurance. Due to various factors, including inflation, we\\nanticipate that our insurance costs will continue to increase and will impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include more asset-\\nintensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and Flexdrive. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring\\ncosts, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of\\nutilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise not successful or we decide to shut down any such offerings, our investments may not generate sufficient\\nreturns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding\\nrelated to driver classification matters may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (including potentially suspending or\\nceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which\\ncould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other equity awards is expected to continue to be a significant\\nexpense for the foreseeable future, and as of December\\xa031, 2024, we had $160.4 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all\\nunvested awards, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 year. Any failure to increase our\\nrevenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on\\na consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nAs our business evolves, our revenue growth rates and results of operations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include changes in\\nthe macroeconomic environment, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing competition or changes in market dynamics, a decrease in the growth of our\\noverall market or market saturation, public health crises, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our business model and our failure\\nto capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of supply and demand and\\nfrequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that\\nmay be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic or technological advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to\\ncompetitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience fluctuations or a decline in\\nmarket share, a decline in gross bookings, revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur market share has fluctuated over time and we have had to take actions, such as price cuts, that have negative impacts on our financial results in the short\\nterm, either because of decreased revenue or increased investments, or both, that we believe will benefit our company in the long term.\\nOur main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other transportation network companies and\\ntaxicab and livery companies, as well as traditional automotive manufacturers and technology companies. Our main competitors in bike and scooter sharing\\ninclude Lime, Bird, Fifteen, nextbike and Dott. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment,\\nparticularly in markets outside of the United States.\\nAdditionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-\\nridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a\\nnumber of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS offerings that either are competing with us or may compete with us in the future,\\nincluding Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Baidu, Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and\\nsuppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.\\nCertain of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other\\nresources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the\\ndevelopment, promotion and sale of offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could\\n15\\nadversely affect the health of our marketplace and our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to deploy towards the research,\\ndevelopment and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have other financial,\\ntechnical or resource advantages. These factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater gross bookings, revenue and profits from\\ntheir existing user bases, attract and retain qualified drivers and riders at lower costs, offer more attractive pricing on their platforms or respond more quickly to\\nnew and emerging technologies, revenue opportunities and trends. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic\\nrelationships, or consolidate, amongst themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, and if we are unable to compete\\nsuccessfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur results of operations vary and are difficult to predict from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\\ndecline.\\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety\\nof reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter\\nand year-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that\\nmay cause our results of operations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our\\nfinancial guidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to\\ndecline.\\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and\\ndevelopment and if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nPrior to 2020, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to\\ngrow, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether\\ndemand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\\nwillingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our\\nShared Rides offerings, and we were temporarily restricted from operating our scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety\\nmeasures. We had to suspend or discontinue these offerings from time to time due to various concerns. In the event of significant public health concerns, such\\nas COVID-19, or other events beyond our control, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive\\nridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability, longer-term\\nbehavioral and social shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\\nplatforms, health concerns, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not\\nachieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings,\\nand we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, we currently offer\\nShared Rides in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select markets. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and\\nprocedures and to increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered\\xa0sign-up\\xa0and referral\\nbonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally\\nable to switch between our platform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling\\nopportunities to increase earnings and other incentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors\\nand other companies in the app-based work industry or other industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements\\nfor drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our\\nplatform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For\\nexample, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered\\nincreased incentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods been negatively impacted by supply incentives, and\\nto the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be\\nnegatively impacted in the future. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities\\ndescribed in the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with settlements with the New York and Massachusetts Attorneys General, the Company is\\ncontinuing to implement certain operational changes that entail increased costs. Further, other jurisdictions have adopted or may adopt similar laws and\\nregulations, and we may reach similar or other settlements with other jurisdictions, any of which may increase our expenses. Litigation seeking to reclassify\\ndrivers as employees is\\n16\\npending and/or threatened in multiple jurisdictions, including as described in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies\\nto the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we may be\\nrequired to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those jurisdictions, and we may incur significant expenses to resolve the\\nmatters at issue in the litigation. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an employment model that we have not historically used or to cease\\noperations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our\\nability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to meet rider demand.\\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to\\nincrease their utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified\\ndrivers or fail to increase utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\\nimmigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result\\nin increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and\\ndevelopment efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other\\nfactors outside of our control, such as concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the\\navailability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or\\ntheir utilization of our platform, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to increase their\\nutilization of our platform or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive\\nprice of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be harmed.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by\\ncurrent riders. Riders have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and\\nbike and scooter sharing offerings. Rider preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our rider base, we must appeal to new riders who have\\nhistorically used other forms of transportation or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have\\nbeen and will continue to be critical in promoting awareness of our offerings, which in turn drives new rider growth and rider utilization. However, our\\nreputation, brand and ability to build trust with existing and new riders may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings,\\nour policies, including our pricing algorithms and pricing policies, the quality of our service, including timely pick-ups, drivers on our platform, or our\\ncompetitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Further, if existing and new riders do not perceive the transportation services provided by\\ndrivers on our platform to be reliable, safe and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant offerings and features on our platform, we may not be able to\\nattract or retain riders or to increase their utilization of our platform. As we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals\\nfrom our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remain satisfied with our offerings. In addition, we have\\nexperienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the winter months, which may harm our ability to\\nattract and retain riders during such periods. We have experienced volatility in the health of our overall marketplace, and demand for our platform has not\\nreturned to pre-2020 levels in all markets. We cannot predict whether these impacts will continue, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider\\nbase, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform by existing riders, we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level of\\nride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization\\nof our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and\\nreinsure our operations-related risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are\\nunable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nFrom the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we,\\nthrough our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary and deductibles, often bear substantial financial risk with respect to auto-related incidents, including auto\\nliability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and\\ngeneral business liabilities up to certain limits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related\\nrisks, we procure a number of third-party insurance policies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In nearly all U.S. states, our insurance\\nsubsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, of the auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our\\nreinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance\\nproviders are reimbursed for claims payments. If we fail to comply with state\\n17\\ninsurance regulatory requirements or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected. If any of our third-party insurance providers or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become\\ninsolvent, they could be unable to pay any claims that we make.\\nWe also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers’\\ncompensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability and general business liabilities, including product\\nliability. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to,\\nacquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and\\nevolving offerings, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our\\ninsurance or reinsurance providers becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded\\nfrom insurance coverage including, but not limited to losses caused by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.\\nThe amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate\\ncoverage limits, for which we have borne and could continue to bear a portion of the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with\\ndeductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of\\ncoverages and for a variety of commercial risks and are likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase, or we may\\ndecide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i)\\xa0cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical\\nexperience, (ii)\\xa0we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii)\\xa0our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv)\\xa0we experience a\\nclaim for which coverage is not provided, (v)\\xa0the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic\\naverages, (vi) an insurance policy is canceled or non-renewed, or (vii) other insurance providers for drivers on our platform become insolvent.\\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and\\nwe periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned.\\nWe employ various predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on available historical experience and industry\\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently\\ndifficult, subjective and speculative. While an independent actuarial firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve\\nvaluations, a number of external factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim\\nremains open, increases in healthcare costs, increases in automotive costs (including rental vehicles), legislative and regulatory developments, judicial\\ndevelopments and unexpected events. Such factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to\\nestimate the reserves for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. The automotive insurance\\nindustry has experienced rising costs due to, among other things, inflation, supply chain challenges, and the increasing cost of medical care, which has driven\\nan increase in actual losses in recent periods, and we expect these costs to continue to drive increased actual losses. Additionally, our insurance providers have\\nencountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the\\nforegoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our\\nconsolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the\\ntime of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial\\ncondition and results of operations. For example, we have in the past experienced adverse development where we have needed to increase historical reserves\\nattributable to liabilities in prior periods.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance\\nclaims to our expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service\\nproviders fail to service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not\\nfavorable to drivers or to us, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time\\nframe or at all. If we cannot find alternate third-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to\\nservicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.\\nIn recent periods, the automotive insurance industry has experienced rising costs due to, among other things, inflation, supply chain challenges, and\\nthe cost of medical care, which has harmed our business, financial condition and results of operations, including\\n18\\nthrough increased insurance renewal costs, and we expect it to continue to negatively impact the automotive insurance industry and our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nWe have, from time to time, sold portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties, including as described in the “Insurance Reserves” subheading in\\nNote 8, Supplemental Financial Statement Information to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These\\ntransactions may cause us to incur additional expenses in the total cost of this risk, and we are subject to recapture of the risk if any third party reinsurer were to\\ndefault on their reinsurance obligation.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could\\npotentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to\\nmaintain and continue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the\\nnetwork effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. The successful\\ndevelopment of our reputation, brand and network effects will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Negative perception of\\nour platform or company may harm our reputation, brand and networks effects, including as a result of:\\n•\\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, drivers on our platform, riders, our product offerings, our ability to deliver on product promises, pricing or\\nour policies and guidelines, including our practices and policies with respect to drivers, or the ridesharing industry, even if factually incorrect or based\\non isolated incidents;\\n•\\nillegal, negligent, reckless or otherwise inappropriate behavior by drivers or riders or third parties, or concerns about the safety of our platform or\\nridesharing in general;\\n•\\na failure to provide drivers with a sufficient level of ride requests, charge drivers fees and commissions that are competitive or provide drivers with\\ncompetitive fares and incentives;\\n•\\na failure to offer riders competitive ride pricing and pick-up times or the desired range of ride types;\\n•\\nactual or perceived disruptions of or defects in our platform, such as privacy or data security breaches or incidents, site outages, payment disruptions\\nor other incidents that impact the reliability of our offerings;\\n•\\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or our business, including any adverse resolution of such litigation or investigations;\\n•\\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies, changes to our policies that are negatively received, or a failure to enforce our policies in\\na manner perceived as effective, fair and transparent;\\n•\\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our stated values and mission, including modification or discontinuation of our\\ncommunity or sustainability programs, illegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors, or\\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees;\\n•\\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support service experiences;\\n•\\nnegative responses by drivers or riders to new offerings on our platform;\\n•\\naccidents, defects or other negative incidents involving autonomous vehicles or Light Vehicles on our platform or Light Vehicles sold to third parties;\\n•\\npolitical or social policies or activities, including our response to employee sentiment related to these matters; or\\n•\\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our\\nindustry as a whole.\\nIf we do not successfully maintain and develop our brand, reputation and network effects and successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive\\nofferings, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose existing qualified drivers or existing riders or fail to attract\\nnew qualified drivers or new riders, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes we\\nmay make to enhance and improve our offerings and balance the needs and interests of the drivers and riders on our platform may be viewed positively from\\none group’s perspective\\n19\\n(such as riders) but negatively from another’s perspective (such as drivers), or may not be viewed positively by either drivers or riders. If we fail to balance the\\ninterests of drivers and riders or make changes that they view negatively, drivers and riders may stop using our platform, take fewer rides or use alternative\\nplatforms, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity of users, whether or not occurring while utilizing our platform, has and could continue to expose us to\\nliability and harm our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIllegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities by users, including the activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are\\nnot then receiving or providing services offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating users of our platform could adversely\\naffect our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. These activities may include criminal activity such as assault, theft, unauthorized use of\\ncredit and debit cards or bank accounts, as well as other misconduct such as sharing of rider or driver accounts, and identity theft to create user accounts. While\\nwe have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify and address the risk of these types of activities, these measures may not adequately\\naddress, and are unlikely to prevent, all illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activity by these parties from occurring in connection with our offerings.\\nSuch conduct has and could continue to expose us to liability or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to\\nguard against these illegal, improper or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all drivers undergo annual background checks or our\\ntwo-way rating system and related policies, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent qualified drivers and riders otherwise in good standing from using our\\nofferings, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the growth and\\nretention of the number of qualified drivers and riders on our platform and their utilization of our platform could be negatively impacted. Further, any negative\\npublicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform, on our competitors’ platforms, or on any ridesharing platform, could\\nadversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of the ridesharing industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like\\nours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential and existing drivers, and if such providers fail to furnish and/or provide accurate\\ninformation, or if such providers are unable to complete background checks or are delayed in completing background checks because of data access\\nrestrictions, software outages, cyberattacks, or otherwise, or if we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen the records of potential and existing drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to\\nutilize our platform pursuant to applicable laws or our internal standards. Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we\\ncannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks, or being significantly delayed in\\ncompleting certain background checks, because of data access restrictions, software outages, cyberattacks, unforeseen court or Department of Motor Vehicle\\nclosures, or otherwise, or to the extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of applicable laws or\\nregulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially\\nreasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.\\nIf we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a\\nresult, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do\\nnot meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform,\\nand as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or\\ndrivers on our platform fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security\\nbreaches or incidents, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the\\nforegoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChanges to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we\\ncharge drivers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and\\nmarketing strategies including increased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the\\nfuture offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain\\nqualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. This includes the use of algorithms to set dynamic prices for riders and earnings for drivers that are\\ndependent on various factors, such as the route, time of day, and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have made pricing changes and\\nspent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we\\n20\\nwill be required, through competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform\\nor reduce the fees we charge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in\\nresponse to competitive pressures. These actions may adversely affect our business and financial results and may not have the desired benefits. At times, in\\ncertain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a driver retains, combined\\nwith the driver incentives a driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of gross bookings we generate for a given ride.\\nFurthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies\\nmay not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these\\neffects. For example, state and local laws and regulations regarding pricing limitations during government declared States of Emergency have imposed limits\\non prices for certain services, and state and local laws and regulations have imposed minimum earnings standards for drivers, which, at times, have caused us\\nto increase prices in certain markets, including California, New York, Washington, Massachusetts and Minnesota. We have tested or launched, and expect to in\\nthe future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as our earnings commitment, subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs.\\nWe have also modified, and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. To the extent any strategies,\\ninitiatives or modifications to our pricing methodologies lead to real or perceived harm to driver earnings, our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers may\\nbe adversely affected. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss\\nof market share, negative public perception and harm to our reputation.\\nWhile we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may\\nultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that\\nclassifies a driver utilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing and earnings methodologies, or make other changes to\\nour business and operations, to account for such a change to driver classification. Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and agreements with\\nthe New York and Massachusetts Attorneys General have enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed\\nearnings. The transition has required, and will continue to require, additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to these new\\nmodels, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment\\nstructure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, while the California\\nSupreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to Proposition 22 on July 25, 2024, other potential litigation to overturn Proposition 22, litigation over Lyft’s\\ncompliance with Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the\\nplatform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model, or other changes we may need to make to our business and operations. While we do and\\nwill attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate. We have experienced\\nin the past and may experience in the future underpricing or overpricing of our offerings due to changes we make to the technology used in our pricing. In\\naddition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue to launch new and develop existing\\nasset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and certain vehicles in our Express Drive program, factors such as maintenance, debt service,\\ndepreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect our pricing methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental\\nprograms that may also affect our pricing. Any such changes to our pricing methodologies or our ability to efficiently price our offerings could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently grow and further develop our network of Light Vehicles, which may not grow as we expect or become profitable over time,\\nand manage the related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWhile some major cities have widely adopted bike and scooter sharing, there can be no assurance that new markets we enter will accept, or existing\\nmarkets will continue to accept, bike and scooter sharing, and even if they do, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our related\\nofferings will be successful in such markets. For example, although we have exclusive rights to operate bike or scooter sharing programs in certain\\njurisdictions, we have faced competition in contravention of such rights and have incurred costs to defend against such challenges. A negative determination in\\nother legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, could adversely affect our\\ncompetitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted from operating\\ndue to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. While we do not expect any denial or\\nsuspension in an individual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of\\noperations. Even if we are able to successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this\\nnascent service offering. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the\\npotential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving an increased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and\\nscooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform or incidents involving our competitors’ offerings.\\n21\\nWe design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective\\nsupply of bikes and scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be\\nno assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable\\nbasis, at a reasonable price or at all. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of Light Vehicles and we rely on a small\\nnumber of suppliers, and in some instances a sole supplier, for components and manufacturing services. Similarly, we rely on external vendors to provide field\\nservices to our bike and scooter operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these vendors. Also, from\\ntime to time we transition these services in one or more geographies from one vendor to another, and the transition process could interrupt or otherwise\\nadversely affect our operations.\\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to, among other things, seasonal factors including\\nweather. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles,\\nhowever, we generally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter season and an increase during more temperate and dry\\nseasons. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we\\nhave discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, in recent years, we discontinued\\nour shared scooter and/or shared bike programs in San Diego, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C. and Denver due to a number of factors including\\nonerous contractual requirements, institutionalized theft, and lack of public investment. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges relating to the supply chain for our Light Vehicles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages and our acquisition of PBSC, a\\nproducer and seller of bikeshare equipment and software, has increased that exposure. In the event that our supply of bikes and scooters or key components is\\ninterrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes in\\nbusiness conditions, force majeure, any public health crises or pandemics, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control have\\naffected and could continue to affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market, or deliver products to third\\nparties, on a timely basis.\\nWe incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue\\nincurring such costs as we operate our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate\\ndepending on factors beyond our control including market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial\\nincreases in prices of these assets or the cost of our operations would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Further, customs authorities may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin\\ndeterminations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities, including tariffs on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we\\nhave reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition\\ncould be harmed.\\nOur bikes and scooters or components thereof, including bikes and scooters and components that we design and contract to manufacture using third-\\nparty suppliers, have experienced and may in the future experience quality problems, product issues or acts of vandalism or theft from time to time, which\\ncould result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all\\nproduct issues, vandalism or theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal\\ninjury or products liability claims, and harm to our reputation.\\nIf we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms\\nin a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe currently partner and have partnered in the past with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous\\ndriving is a new and evolving market, which makes it difficult to predict its acceptance, its growth, and the magnitude and timing of necessary investments and\\nother trends, including when it may be more broadly or commercially available. Our initiatives may not perform as expected, which would reduce the return on\\nour investments in this area and our current or future partners may decide to terminate or scale back their partnerships with us. For example, in October 2022,\\none of our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment charge of $135.7 million consisting of\\nimpairments of our non-marketable equity investment in such company and other assets. Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division in\\n2021, we no longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous\\nvehicle technology on our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable\\nrelative to our competitors, or if our efforts to optimize our strategy with regard to our autonomous vehicle technology development are not successful, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and\\n22\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our current or future autonomous vehicle technology partners are delayed or prevented from\\ndeveloping autonomous vehicle technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, a general\\ndecrease in available capital, as well as an increase in regulatory scrutiny could delay or prevent the development of autonomous vehicle technology by our\\npartners.\\nThe autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our\\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous\\ndriving involves a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied on building\\nstrategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is no assurance\\nthat these current or future partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manner or at all. In\\norder to gain acceptance, the reliability of autonomous vehicle technology must continue to advance.\\nAdditional challenges to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\\n•\\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\\n•\\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\\n•\\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\\n•\\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy;\\n•\\nlevels of investment by developers of autonomous vehicle technology; and\\n•\\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.\\nThere are a number of existing laws, regulations and standards that may apply to autonomous vehicle technology, including vehicle standards that\\nwere not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the\\nlikelihood of complex, conflicting or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or\\nsignificantly increase the compliance costs associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous\\nvehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if at all, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our business strategy or that our offerings will be\\nsuccessful in the market. Even if autonomous vehicle technology is successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this\\nnascent technology and its adopters. In particular, there could be negative public perception surrounding autonomous vehicles, including the overall safety and\\nthe potential for injuries or death occurring as a result of accidents involving autonomous vehicles and the potential loss of income to human drivers resulting\\nfrom widespread market adoption of autonomous vehicles. Such negative public perception may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our\\npartners’ or competitors’ platforms, or events around autonomous vehicles more generally. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our\\nprospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClaims from riders, drivers or third parties that allege harm, whether or not our platform is in use, adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-\\nparties. We are also subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for harm related to the\\nactions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including harm caused by criminal activity. We are also\\nsubject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, platform users and third\\nparties have in the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously\\nutilized our platform, but was not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle\\nfor reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to\\nincrease as our business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any\\nriders, drivers or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our\\ninsurance policies and programs may not provide sufficient coverage to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident,\\nor a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we may have to pay high premiums or deductibles for our coverage and, for certain situations\\nand/or categories of claims, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.\\nAs we operate our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings\\nrelated to injuries to, or deaths of, riders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify\\ngovernmental entities or operating partners for claims arising out of issues, including\\n23\\nissues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of our Light Vehicles,\\nregardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure or\\ndecreased use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party suppliers and manufacturers,\\nincluding certain assets and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future contain design or\\nmanufacturing product issues, which could also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all\\nproduct issues, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any\\nof the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur Light Vehicles have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls\\nand removal from service, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nWe design, contract to design and manufacture, sell, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair bikes and scooters for our network of\\nLight Vehicles. Such bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or\\nconstruction, may be improperly maintained or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism\\nhave in the past unexpectedly interfered, and could in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted,\\nand could in the future result, in other safety concerns, including alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our\\nthird-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before they are deployed onto our network or sold, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect\\nor prevent all product issues.\\nFailure to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters\\nhas resulted or may result in a variety of consequences including product recalls and removal from service, service interruptions, alleged injuries, litigation,\\nenforcement actions, including fines or penalties, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of\\nany product issues in, vandalism of, or the failure to properly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or\\nrespond to regulatory inquiries, and our brand and reputation may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of\\nLight Vehicles and adversely affect our business, brand, financial conditions and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe expect to continue to grow our business, infrastructure and operations over time. Growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant\\ndemands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. From time to time we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our\\nfinancial model and our business. For example, we have from time to time implemented reductions in force to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows\\nin light of ongoing economic challenges. We may need to take additional restructuring actions in the future to align our business with the market. Steps we take\\nto manage our business operations, including workplace policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely\\naffect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.\\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing\\nbusiness will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage\\nemployees. Continued growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting\\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the\\ngrowth of our business and operations, the quality of our offerings could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand,\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission and other processing of our users’ personal data and other sensitive data. Additionally, we\\nmaintain other confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we\\nreceive from third parties. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities we maintain or use in\\nour business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers, partners or users on\\nour platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords, payment\\ncard information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce\\nour employees, partners, customers, users or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In\\naddition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly\\nattribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches or incidents experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example,\\ncredential stuffing attacks are common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be\\nstate-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\\n24\\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users’ data and prevent breaches and incidents, these measures\\ncannot guarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure are subject to cyberattacks,\\nbreaches and incidents, including ransomware or other malware, which have resulted in and may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of\\nour platform. Further, unauthorized parties or authorized third parties may be able to access our users’ personal information and payment card data that are\\naccessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand our operations, including licensing or sharing data with third parties and acquiring or partnering\\nwith other companies, have employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-from-home practices of our\\nemployees, our exposure to cyberattacks, breaches and incidents may increase. As a result of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, there may be a heightened\\nrisk of potential cyberattacks by state actors or others. Further, employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities, bugs or errors in the\\nstorage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived breach or incident. In the past, there have been allegations regarding\\nviolations of our policies restricting access to personal information we store, and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our service\\nproviders also face various security threats, and we and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate,\\nprevent, respond to, or mitigate cyberattacks or security breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to\\ncyberattacks, breaches and incidents.\\nAny actual or perceived breach or incident affecting us or other parties with which we share data or that are processing data on our behalf could\\ninterrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, result in loss, alteration, unavailability or unauthorized use, disclosure\\nor other processing of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with third-party partners, result in\\nregulatory investigations and other proceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept credit or debit card\\npayments, increased card processing fees, and other significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, or\\ndecreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actual or\\nperceived compromise, breach or incident impacting autonomous vehicles, whether through our platform or our competitors’, could result in legal, regulatory\\nand financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform, which could significantly undermine our business. Further, any cyberattacks\\ndirected toward, or breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce confidence in the ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce\\nconfidence in us.\\nWe incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase\\nas we continue to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach\\nor incident, we could be required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to or prevent further breaches or incidents,\\nwhich may require us to divert substantial resources. Moreover, we could be required or otherwise find it appropriate to expend significant capital and other\\nresources to respond to, notify third parties of, and otherwise address the breach or incident and its root cause.\\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for such liabilities, that insurance will\\ncontinue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful\\nassertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon\\nWeb Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure\\nservices. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural\\ndisasters, cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is\\ncritical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from\\ntime to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In\\naddition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform’s continuing and\\nuninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become\\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any\\nnegative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings.\\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience\\nafter complying with a one-year advance notice requirement. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to\\npay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition\\nof, new cloud\\n25\\ninfrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform,\\nlead to a significant short term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nOn February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of\\nat least $350\\xa0million between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80\\xa0million in each of the four years. If we fail to\\nmeet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners for our Express Drive program, as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and\\nfinance partners to support our Express Drive program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and other risks related to our Express\\nDrive program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply\\nvehicles to drivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance\\npartners terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, the availability of vehicles for drivers\\nin certain markets could be adversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such\\npartners in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive\\nparts is interrupted, including as a result of public health crises or pandemics, affecting vehicles in these partners’ fleets, the supply of vehicles available from\\nthese partners could become constrained. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected its ability to meet the requirements of\\nour Express Drive program. If we cannot find alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by\\nevents such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able to meet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less\\nattractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to a number of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-\\nrelated insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost from our Express Drive program compared to the corresponding cost from the rest\\nof our ridesharing marketplace offerings. If Flexdrive, Lyft’s independently managed subsidiary, is unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive’s fleet and\\npotential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from drivers, Lyft and Flexdrive may update the pricing methodologies related to\\nFlexdrive’s offering in Lyft’s Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in turn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers\\nthrough the Express Drive program.\\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety\\nconcerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur Express Drive program and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.\\nFor the Express Drive vehicle rental program for drivers operated by our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, a portion of the fleet is\\nsourced from a range of auto manufacturers. In addition, we have established environmental programs that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or\\nvehicles that Flexdrive sources or purchases from. To the extent that any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of\\npurchasing cars or decline to provide cars to Flexdrive on terms or at prices consistent with past agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market\\nand other efforts to mitigate, Flexdrive may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles for Lyft to operate the Express Drive business without\\nsignificantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public health crises such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or Flexdrive’s ability to make vehicles\\navailable for rent through the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the\\nfleets.\\nAlthough new vehicle inventory supply is improving, Flexdrive has previously experienced and may in the future experience production and delivery\\ndelays which can hinder its ability to meet demand and grow the fleet. New vehicle production delays also lead to holding onto existing vehicles longer which\\nin turn leads to increased costs relating to those vehicles.\\nThe costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. Flexdrive currently sells vehicles\\nthrough auctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices and\\nFlexdrive has experienced a softening in the used car market. It may be difficult to estimate the residual value of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those\\nrented to drivers through our Express Drive program. If Flexdrive is unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if Flexdrive is unable\\nto accurately forecast the residual values of vehicles in the fleet, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n26\\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage\\nour relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If\\nany of our third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we\\nwould need to find an alternate payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame.\\nFurther, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be\\ncompromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make\\ntimely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to\\nattract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\\nNearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain\\npayment network or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders\\nthat may be subject to additional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the\\npayments we accept from riders, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to\\ncomply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept\\nonline payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our offerings less convenient and attractive to riders. If any of these events were to\\noccur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and\\nregulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money\\ntransmitter differently. For example, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United\\nStates, we could be subject to additional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new\\njurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter\\nunder any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions\\nlevied by federal, state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for\\nfailing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement\\nactions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\\nFor various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment\\nnetworks and financial institutions. These fees are subject to increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nAdditionally, our payment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card\\nnetworks and which include, among other obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating\\nrules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult\\nto follow, and if we fail or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher\\ntransaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors\\nfor fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or the users on our platform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may\\nincrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on our relationships with other third-party service providers. For example, we rely on third-party encryption and\\nauthentication technologies licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our\\nplatform. Further, from time to time, we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our\\nqualified driver base, the provision of new or enhanced offerings for users on our platform and our expansion into new markets. If any of our partners\\nterminates its relationship with us, or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider,\\nand may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that our strategic partners experience\\na disruption in their operations, our ability to continue providing certain product offerings could become constrained. If we cannot find alternate partners, we\\nmay not be able to meet the demand for these product offerings, and as a result, these offerings and our platform may become less attractive. We also rely on\\nother software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent\\nsuch software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\\nincrease our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-\\nparty partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation\\n27\\nand brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, in certain cases, we rely on these third-party partners to provide\\ncertain data that is important to the management of our business. Errors in the data, or failure to provide data in a timely manner, could adversely affect our\\nability to manage our business and could impact the accuracy of our financial reporting.\\nWe use and incorporate technology and intellectual property from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that\\nsuch technology, intellectual property, or third parties are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these third parties have sufficient rights\\nto the technology or intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for\\nconvenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third\\nparties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially\\nreasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could be severely limited\\nand our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to access necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop\\nalternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards and may subject us to certain risks\\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraph that are currently borne by third parties. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive offerings\\nand increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed or if we are unable to develop such alternate technology at commercially\\nreasonable levels of risk, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOur advertising business, Lyft Media, is nascent and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business and financial\\nresults.\\nWe have introduced Lyft Media, a media and advertising business from which we earn revenue from third parties who advertise through various\\nofferings on our platform. We have limited experience and operating history offering media and advertising on our platform, and our efforts to develop Lyft\\nMedia and generate revenue are still in the early stages. We may never generate sufficient revenue to offset our investment or achieve the returns we expect.\\nLyft Media and our ability to generate and increase revenue from Lyft Media are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including:\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain advertisers, particularly because our advertisers do not have long-term commitments with us;\\n•\\nour ability to deliver advertisements in an effective manner;\\n•\\nour ability to compete effectively for advertising spend, including our ability to create products and offerings that are perceived as valuable to\\nadvertisers;\\n•\\nthe impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\\n•\\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our\\nads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\\n•\\nour failure to increase the number of riders who engage with Lyft Media;\\n•\\nchanges in our viewer demographics that make us less attractive to advertisers;\\n•\\nadverse legal developments relating to advertising, including with respect to ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n•\\nour inability to deliver advertisements due to hardware, software or network limitations;\\n•\\nchanges in third-party policies such as changes to mobile device operating systems that impose heightened restrictions on our access and use of user\\ndata by allowing users to more easily opt-out of tracking of activity across devices, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and\\nselect ads to be served;\\n•\\nregulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection, use and other processing of information and other privacy considerations,\\nincluding regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n•\\nproduct changes or advertising inventory management decisions we may make that change the type, size or frequency of advertisements displayed on\\nLyft Media;\\n•\\nadverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our business or advertisers on our platform that may impact our brand and reputation\\nand the willingness of advertisers to advertise on our platform;\\n•\\nany liability, brand or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our platform;\\n•\\nany uncertainty related to third party agreements to manage, sell ads, or otherwise to provide services in the Lyft Media ecosystem;\\n•\\nadvertisers may not agree to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines;\\n28\\n•\\nany driver, rider or third-party dissatisfaction due to advertisements; and\\n•\\nour ability to increase or maintain driver adoption and use of Lyft Media products.\\nThese and other factors could harm our Lyft Media business and the ability of our Lyft Media business to achieve the return on investment we expect\\nwhich could harm our business.\\nUse of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets\\nused, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\\nWe use artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning and automated decision making) for our internal work streams and productivity as\\nwell as in our platform, offerings, services and features, which may present additional risks, including risks inherent in its use. We are making investments in\\nexpanding our AI capabilities in our platform, offerings, services and features, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning\\nand AI technologies, as well as developing new features using AI technologies, including, for example, generative AI. AI algorithms or automated processing\\nof data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain inaccurate or biased information, which can create discriminatory outcomes. AI algorithms\\nmay use third-party inputs with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of\\ngenerative and other AI output, have not been fully interpreted by courts or fully addressed by federal or state regulations. The United States and other\\ncountries are considering comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the European Union has\\nadopted the first such framework in its Artificial Intelligence Act. In addition, there may be additional legislation or regulations from government bodies that\\nsimilarly impose compliance obligations for AI. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with such requirements could have an\\nadverse impact on our business. AI use or management by us or others, including decisions based on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or\\ncontroversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning, automated decision making, and algorithms, have and could impair the\\noperationality or acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as negative impacts to the value of our\\nintellectual property or our brand. These deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to\\nunintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require\\nus to allocate additional resources to help implement AI in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make additional\\ninvestments in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.\\nIf we are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings\\nwill depend in part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we\\nmay introduce significant changes to our existing offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven offerings. If these new or enhanced offerings are\\nunsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits or authorizations or other regulatory constraints or because they fail\\nto generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, new driver\\nor rider demands regarding service or platform features, the availability of superior competitive offerings or a deterioration in the quality of our offerings or our\\nability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness of our platform and the economics of our\\nbusiness and require us to make substantial changes to and additional investments in our offerings or our business model. In addition, we frequently experiment\\nwith and test different offerings and marketing strategies. For example, in September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that currently offers\\nwomen and nonbinary riders and drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders\\nand drivers, and in 2024, we extended Women+ Connect nationwide. In July 2024, we launched a new Price Lock product, which allows riders to purchase a\\nmonthly subscription that caps the price for a specified route during a specified one-hour time window. Additionally, in May 2024, we launched a driver\\nearnings commitment nationwide in the United States where we promise a driver will earn at least 70% of weekly passenger payments after external fees. If a\\ndriver’s weekly earnings are below the 70% commitment, they will receive a true-up payment for the difference. Any significant inability to deliver on the\\ncommitment could lead to brand and reputational harm and create potential legal risk. If our experiments and tests are unsuccessful, or if the offerings and\\nstrategies we introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new\\nriders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.\\nDeveloping and launching new offerings or enhancements to the existing offerings on our platform involves significant risks and uncertainties,\\nincluding risks related to the reception of such offerings by existing and potential future drivers and riders, increases in operational complexity, unanticipated\\ndelays or challenges in implementing such offerings or enhancements, increased strain on our operational and internal resources (including an impairment of\\nour ability to accurately forecast rider demand and the number of drivers using our platform), our dependence on strategic commercial partnerships, and\\nnegative publicity in the event such new or enhanced offerings are perceived to be unsuccessful. We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new\\ninitiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in, operational challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching\\n29\\nnew offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front capital investments and such investments may not generate\\nsufficient returns on investment. Further, from time to time we may reevaluate, discontinue and/or reduce these investments and decide to discontinue one or\\nmore offerings. For example, we shut down our vehicle services offering and parking offering, which were initially launched in 2021. Any of the foregoing\\nrisks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and\\nour visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, since we\\nare focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operations may be impacted by our investments in the\\nfuture.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our multimodal platform, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nOur expansion, either through our first party offerings or third-party offerings through our partnerships, into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of\\ntransportation and vehicle rental program has increased the complexity of our business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and\\nmarketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us to new laws, regulations and risks. For example, our Wait & Save offering, which enables riders to\\nopt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride, involves inherent challenges\\nin predicting the future locations of drivers. We also face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party\\npublic transit data into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time\\nwe reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform and have in the past decided and may again decide to discontinue or modify an offering or certain\\nfeatures. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may not provide the benefits we expect in the long term. If we are unable to\\nsuccessfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including the effects our new and evolving offerings have on our\\nexisting business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived\\ninaccuracies in those metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make\\nstrategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from\\nestimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely,\\nand we may make material adjustments to our processes for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, reflect newly available information, address\\nerrors in our methodologies, or other reasons, which may result in changes to our metrics. The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and\\nexpected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have\\nforecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Further, as our business develops, we may introduce, revise or cease reporting certain\\nmetrics if we change how we manage our business such that new metrics are appropriate, if we determine that revisions are required to accurately or\\nappropriately measure our performance, or if one or more metrics no longer represents an effective way to evaluate our business. If investors or analysts do not\\nconsider our metrics to be accurate representations of our business or compare our metrics to third party estimates or similarly titled metrics of our competitors\\nor others in our industry that are not calculated on the same basis, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A\\ncommon stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nAny failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to\\nprovide high-quality support, including both in-person and remote support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\\nrelating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leaving something in a driver’s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide\\neffective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain service providers who are qualified to support users and sufficiently\\nknowledgeable regarding our offerings. As we continue to grow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing quality\\nsupport services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of international drivers on our platform, our support organization will face\\nadditional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to provide efficient and effective user\\nsupport, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nFailure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business.\\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data,\\nclaims of unauthorized payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds, fraud committed by drivers, riders or third parties, and fraud\\ncommitted by riders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities, including those involving\\npersonal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of\\ncredit or debit card\\n30\\ndetails, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current card payment practices, we may be liable for rides facilitated on our\\nplatform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures that we have taken\\nto detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or\\nwill scale efficiently with our business. Our inability to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in\\nlitigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe have also incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from fraud and other misuse of our platform by drivers and riders. As an example of losses,\\nwe have previously and continue to experience reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilled and miles traveled in connection with our\\nConcierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platform solutions or other means, our\\npartner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively balance driver supply and rider demand on our Wait & Save and Priority Pickup offerings, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we fail to efficiently balance driver supply and rider demand on our Wait & Save and Priority Pickup offerings and manage the related pricing\\nmethodologies and logistics, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Wait & Save enables riders to opt for a\\nlonger wait time but pay a lower fare than for a Standard ride, while drivers earn the same as they do for a Standard ride. Priority Pickup enables riders to pay\\nan additional fee for prioritized ride matching with the goal of achieving a shorter wait time. Both Priority Pickup and Wait & Save allow for the rider to be\\nmatched with the best-located driver and involve inherent challenges in predicting the future location of drivers. Accordingly, if our algorithms are unable to\\nconsistently match Wait & Save and Priority Pickup riders, or with appropriate drivers, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\\nadversely affected.\\nIf we fail to effectively manage our pricing methodologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWith our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform and service\\nfees from drivers. Service fees are a set fee per ride. Platform fees are variable fees, based upon the amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-\\nfront quoted fare, less the amount earned by the driver (which is based on one or both of the following: (a) the actual time and distance for the trip, or (b) an up-\\nfront fare), the service fee, any applicable driver bonuses or incentives, and any pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. For more information\\non platform fees, see our Terms of Service, including the Driver Addendum. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the\\ntime and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. Additionally, Shared Rides, a limited-scope\\noffering for business-to-business partnerships in select markets, enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to generate a discounted fare at the cost\\nof possibly longer travel times. The fare charged for the Shared Ride is decoupled from the payment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment\\nbased on the success or failure of a match. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider is less than the amount we\\ncommitted to the driver. In addition, riders’ price sensitivity varies by geographic location, among other factors, and if we are unable to effectively account for\\nsuch variability in our breadth of offerings or up-front prices, our ability to compete effectively in these locations could be adversely affected. From time to\\ntime we adjust our prices due to these factors, which may harm our results of operations. We also utilize certain AI and machine-learning technologies and\\nalgorithms to optimize our pricing and marketplace. Errors in AI, machine-learning technologies, algorithms, or the inputted data, including insufficient data\\nsets or biased information, or the processing of the data may lead to discriminatory or other adverse outcomes. In July 2024, we launched a new Price Lock\\nproduct that allows riders to purchase a monthly subscription that caps the price for a specified route during a specified one-hour time window, subject to a\\nmaximum amount of savings in any given month. With the Price Lock product, if we set the capped prices too low or too high compared to actual on-demand\\nprices, we may incur losses or it may negatively impact subscriber growth. If we are unable to effectively manage our pricing methodologies in conjunction\\nwith our existing and future pricing and incentive programs and/or products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.\\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy and support for others, has been critical to our success. We face a number\\nof challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\\n•\\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\\n•\\nthe size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\\n•\\nour flexible workplace strategies, which enable certain of our employees to work in a hybrid workplace environment or remotely;\\n31\\n•\\nadherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\\n•\\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\\n•\\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\\n•\\nthe impact of our cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in force and other actions we may take to drive operating efficiencies;\\n•\\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\\n•\\nperception of our treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\\n•\\ntransitions among our executive leadership;\\n•\\nthe provision of employee benefits in a hybrid and remote work environment; and\\n•\\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\\nFrom time to time, we have undertaken workforce reductions in order to better align our operations with our strategic priorities, manage our cost\\nstructure or in connection with acquisitions. For example, in response to the effects of the macroeconomic environment and efforts to reduce operating\\nexpenses, we have from time to time implemented reductions in force. These actions may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to\\nattract and retain personnel. If we are not able to maintain our culture, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of our senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and\\non our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. In the second quarter of 2023,\\nour co-founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, transitioned from their management roles and David Risher, a member of our board of directors, became\\nChief Executive Officer. From time to time, we have experienced transitions in executive leadership roles. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining\\nqualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to economic and other factors impacting our business may harm our\\nreputation or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for us\\non an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members\\nof our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If\\nwe are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.\\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for\\nhighly skilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and could continue to intensify for such personnel. To attract and retain top talent,\\nwe have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel\\noften consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The decline in our stock price and our cost reduction initiatives\\nmay adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition or we may need to provide additional\\ncash or equity compensation to retain employees. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions\\nand many of our employees have received and may continue to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce\\ntheir motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend\\nsignificant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable\\nto effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and employee morale, productivity and\\nretention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to\\ncomply with existing or future laws governing the Internet and mobile devices.\\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device and the Internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited\\nInternet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with\\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet\\ninfrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such\\nfailure in Internet or mobile device accessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\\n32\\nMoreover, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving.\\nExisting and future laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change\\nour business practices or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy\\nand data protection, information security, pricing, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices, consumer protections, web\\nand app accessibility, antitrust and competition, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our offerings and the characteristics\\nand quality of online offerings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in\\ndamage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely impact\\nour results of operations.\\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our apps available to the drivers and riders on our platform, and if we do not\\neffectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces and maintain high rider reviews, our usage or brand\\nrecognition could decline and our business, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our apps available to\\nthe drivers and riders on our platform. Any changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential\\ntreatment to our competitors’ apps could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces\\nlimit or prohibit us from making our apps available to drivers and riders, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our\\napps, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement\\nin such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could\\nslow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations in the number of downloads in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing\\nrisks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform or\\neffectively roll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively\\nwith a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key\\nparticipants in the mobile industry that enhance drivers’ and riders’ experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using\\nour apps on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve,\\nincluding to the extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications,\\nproducts and services. Third-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to\\nensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take\\nactions which disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms\\non which we operate and distribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to increase. Should any of\\nour competitors or technology partners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our\\nplatform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system\\nfailures and resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and\\nadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered\\nafter the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as “continuous deployment,” which refers to the frequent release of\\nour software code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying\\nour platform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities\\ndiscovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other\\nperformance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result\\nin a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or\\ndefects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.\\n33\\nFurther, our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and\\nsoftware defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters,\\npower losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware or\\nother events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our\\nsystems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be\\nsufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the\\navailability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our offerings. These events have resulted in, and similar future events could result in, losses of\\nrevenue or additional costs and expenses. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our\\nofferings could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event\\nresults in harm or losses to the users using our platform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek\\nmonetary recourse or contractual remedies from us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\\naddress.\\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses\\ncould restrict our ability to provide our offerings.\\nOur platform and offerings contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open\\nsource software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties,\\nindemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software\\nmay make it easier for others to compromise our platform and offerings.\\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\\ntype of open source software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a\\ncertain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow\\nour competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages.\\nAlternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-\\nengineer some or all of our software.\\nAlthough we have policies and processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend,\\nthe terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been\\nclaims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be\\nsubject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for\\ncontrolling our use of open source software in our platform will be effective. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and\\nconditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue\\nproviding our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if re-\\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur presence outside the United States and our international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be\\nsuccessful.\\nSince 2017, we have provided and expanded our offerings in international markets. In addition, we have several international offices that support our\\nbusiness. We also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future.\\nOperating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural\\nnorms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, human resources, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may\\nincur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\\n•\\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\\n•\\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively and may enjoy greater local\\naffinity or awareness;\\n•\\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\\n34\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as natural disasters, pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\\n•\\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance, anti-\\nbribery and anti-corruption, antitrust, securities, environmental, employment, insurance, and local regulatory restrictions and disclosure requirements;\\n•\\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property\\nand other confidential business information;\\n•\\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\\n•\\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\\n•\\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\\n•\\npolitical, economic, or social instability, which has caused disruptions in certain of our office locations, including in Ukraine as a result of the war;\\n•\\ntax policies, treaties or laws that could have an unfavorable business impact; and\\n•\\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake\\nmay not be successful, which may result in shutting down international operations or closing international offices, which could result in additional costs and\\ncash requirements, any of which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our\\noperations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\\naffected.\\nIn addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with\\nrespect to customs, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political activity, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. Continued international expansion,\\nincluding possible engagement with foreign government entities and organizations as customers for our Light Vehicle offerings, including bike-share products\\nthrough PBSC, may further increase such compliance risks. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable\\nlaws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In particular, any violation of applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, lobbying, export controls,\\nsanctions and similar laws could result in adverse media coverage, investigations, significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil\\npenalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management’s attention, all of which could have an\\nadverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRisks Related to General Economic Factors\\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions. Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or\\nrecession, inflation and related high interest rates, increases to fuel and other energy costs or vehicle costs, changes in the labor market or decreases in\\nconsumer spending power or confidence, are likely to result in decreased discretionary spending and reduced demand for our platform. Further, changes in\\ncorporate spending, including cost-cuts and layoffs, may adversely impact business travel, commuting and other business-related expenditures and impact our\\nLyft Business customers. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in the banking and financial services sectors, inflation and high interest rates, increased fuel and\\nother energy costs, increased labor and benefits costs and increased insurance costs have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which has\\nled, and could lead, to greater operating expenses. For example, inflation has increased in recent years and is expected to further increase medical costs and\\nvehicle repair costs, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts, which has resulted in increases in our insurance costs. Similarly, these factors, as\\nwell as increased fuel costs, increase our costs as well as costs for drivers on our platform. Many of these factors are out of our control and make it difficult to\\naccurately forecast gross bookings, revenues and operating results, particularly in the long-term, and could negatively affect our ability to meet our target\\noperating performance and our (and our strategic partners’) ability to make decisions about future investments and strategies. Further, we may need to make\\nchanges to our business to respond to these conditions and be able to compete effectively. For example, we have adjusted our pricing in response to competitive\\npressures caused by changes in our marketplace, which has in the past contributed to a decline in our revenue and may cause a decline in revenue in future\\nquarters. An economic downturn resulting in a prolonged recessionary period would likely have a further adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\n35\\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other unexpected events.\\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile\\nnetworks, the Internet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay\\nArea, a region known for seismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises\\nor pandemics, other epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or\\nother catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have an\\noffice and employees in Ukraine that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current war in the region, including displacement of our\\nemployees. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or our third-party providers’ abilities could result in driver supply and\\nrider demand imbalances, decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, or increase our costs and operating expenses, which\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster\\nrecovery plans prove to be inadequate.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could\\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs,\\nlivery, vehicles for hire, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing\\nand worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, personal injury, marketing, advertising, text messaging, subscription services,\\nintellectual property, AI, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration\\nagreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, web and mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing,\\ninsurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety,\\ngreenhouse gas emissions and EVs, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export\\nrestrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods are often complex and subject to\\nvarying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial\\ndecisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a\\npeer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that\\nwere in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our\\nrelationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local\\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part\\ndue to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and\\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related\\ntechnologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or\\nusers on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our\\nplatform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including\\nairports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter\\nsharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny\\nrenewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of\\nerrors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and\\ngovernmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or\\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in\\nthe market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business.\\nSee the risk factor entitled “Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other\\nconsequences to our business.” Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have\\na negative outcome that could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from\\ntime to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations,\\nparticularly those related to the ridesharing industry,\\n36\\nwhich may negatively impact the legal and administrative proceedings challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors if we\\nare unsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could\\nadversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state, provincial and municipal regulatory authorities\\nacross the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and certain jurisdictions\\nhave adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate\\nhave and could continue to consider legislation regulating driver earnings. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we\\nexpand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. In addition, we may face regulations relating to new\\nor developing technologies. For example, the European Union has adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act, which imposes operational and regulatory\\nrequirements relating to the use of AI technologies, and other jurisdictions have adopted and may continue to adopt laws and regulations relating to AI. Adverse\\nchanges in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or material limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model\\nnegatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may\\ncontinue to take actions and employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a\\nmarket presence in an effort to change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers\\nand riders to utilize our platform.\\nAny of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChallenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our\\nbusiness.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory\\nproceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing\\nwhether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern\\nthe status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create\\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us. For more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading\\nin Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in 2021, the U.S.\\nSecretary of Labor expressed his view that in some cases “gig workers should be classified as employees” and that further review was ongoing. On June 13,\\n2023, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) issued a ruling in Atlanta Opera, reverting back to a more expansive federal test for classifying\\nindependent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”), the federal law that governs collective bargaining. On January 10, 2024, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Labor issued a new final rule containing interpretive guidance for the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors,\\nreverting back to a multi-factor “economic realities” test to determine if a worker was properly classified under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).\\nThe rule became effective on March 11, 2024, and is currently under legal challenges. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent\\ncontractors in such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters, as applicable, but our\\narguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal\\nproceeding or not, related to driver classification matters, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of:\\n•\\nmonetary exposure arising from or relating to alleged failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements\\n(such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), unlawful deductions,\\nexpense reimbursement, restitution, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and\\ngovernment fines;\\n•\\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\\n•\\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment;\\n•\\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\\n•\\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity (for example, the recent passage by the\\nvoters of Massachusetts of ballot Question 3, which sets up a sectoral bargaining framework between drivers and rideshare companies);\\n37\\n•\\nother claims, charges or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of\\njoint employer liability or agency liability; and\\n•\\nharm to our reputation and brand.\\nIn addition to the harms listed above, in the event of a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver\\nclassification matters, we may decide to, or be required to, significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing\\noperations in impacted jurisdictions), our costs may increase, and we may experience adverse impacts on our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and\\ngrow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to achieve or maintain\\nprofitability in the future.\\nWe have been involved in numerous legal proceedings related to driver classification. We are currently involved in several putative class actions,\\nseveral representative actions brought, for example, pursuant to California’s Private Attorneys General Act, several multi-plaintiff actions and thousands of\\nindividual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers\\non our platform as independent contractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in multiple jurisdictions. See the\\nsection titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\nClaims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\\nCompanies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of\\nintellectual property rights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they\\nown, have purchased or otherwise obtained. As our business continues to evolve, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on\\nthe following: increase in public profile, increases in the number of competitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products\\nand services, and new intellectual property, as well as potential international expansion. In addition, various products and services of ours host, integrate, or\\notherwise rely on third party content or intellectual property, including our Lyft Media efforts, which provides a platform for third-party promotional\\nadvertisements, and our marketing and brand journalism efforts. From time to time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of\\ninfringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal\\nproceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual property infringement and, in some instances,\\nhave sought to initiate licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in\\ndefending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have\\nsignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding\\ncompanies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or\\nno deterrence or protection. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent-holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial\\nresources to assert their intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial\\ncosts defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property.\\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential\\ninformation during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a\\njudgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us from using or distributing our intellectual property, or we may\\nagree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights,\\nwhich may not be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-\\nexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual\\nproperty on reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require\\nsignificant time (during which we would be unable to continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of\\nthese events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other\\nforms of information, knowhow and technology), or “intellectual property,” and as we grow, we expect to continue to develop intellectual property that is\\nimportant for our existing or future business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and\\ncontractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or\\neffective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we\\nundertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take\\n38\\nprecautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology,\\nreverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position\\nin our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our\\ntechnology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of\\nprotection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property protections may not be available or may be limited\\nin foreign countries. Our domestic and international intellectual property protection and enforcement strategy is influenced by many considerations including\\ncosts, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future, legal protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or\\nother strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection in all jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to\\noperate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized use, copying, transfer and\\ndisclosure of proprietary information will likely increase. We may need to expend additional resources to protect, enforce or defend our intellectual property\\nrights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international operations. We enter into\\nconfidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party\\nproviders and strategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform\\nand proprietary information. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially\\nequivalent or superior to our offerings. Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to access, aggregate, and/or reverse engineer our data which would\\ncompromise our trade secrets and other rights. We also enter into strategic partnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties\\nwhere intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned or may be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may\\nlimit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint\\ndevelopment partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint\\ndevelopment partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned\\nintellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.\\nWe may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult\\nor impossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and\\ncould result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses,\\ncounterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and\\nproprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could\\nimpair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into\\nour platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new\\nofferings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\\nOur industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, including by foreign actors. We, along with others in our industry, have\\nbeen the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although we take measures to protect our\\nproperty, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be undermined and our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to\\ncomply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could\\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe receive, transmit, store and otherwise process a large volume of personal information and other data relating to users on our platform, as well as\\nother individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and\\nthe collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information\\nProtection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the\\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the\\nHITECH Act, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the California\\nPrivacy Rights Act, or CPRA. The scope of data protection laws may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and\\nchanges in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CPRA requires new disclosures to California consumers\\nand affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information. The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per\\nviolation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement remain unclear. Additionally, several\\nstates in the U.S., including California and other states where we do business, have enacted legislation relating to privacy and information security, and the U.S.\\nfederal government and other states are also contemplating federal and state privacy legislation. These new and modified laws, including the CPRA, and other\\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security,\\n39\\nparticularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or\\ndisclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes to our operations and our data processing practices and\\npolicies, may require us to incur additional compliance-related costs and expenses, and may even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in\\nwhich we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\\nFurther, as we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional privacy-related laws and regulations. For\\nexample, in connection with the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other\\nagreements with Woven Planet to facilitate and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. In addition, our Lyft Media efforts provide third\\nparty promotional advertisements, including those that may be personalized to users. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit\\nactivities in regard to any new offerings we undertake.\\nAs another example, the collection and storage of data, including in connection with the use of our Concierge and Lyft Pass for Public Funding\\nofferings by healthcare customers, subjects us to compliance requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements on\\nCovered Entities and Business Associates, each as defined under HIPAA, regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure of individuals’ protected\\nhealth information, or PHI. Contracted healthcare customers including healthcare providers, health plans, and transportation brokers using our Concierge or\\nLyft Pass for Public Funding offerings are either Covered Entities or Business Associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and\\ndisclose the PHI of riders in our capacity as a Business Associate of Covered Entities or of other Business Associates. Compliance obligations under HIPAA\\ninclude privacy, security and breach notification obligations and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI\\ndetermined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly breach the HITECH Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards\\nand processes could expose us to significant civil penalties that range from $100 - $72,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year\\ncap of over $2,000,000 for “willful neglect” violations, and the possibility of civil litigation.\\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and\\ninformation security standards imposed by law, regulation, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA\\nimposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and\\nregulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant\\ncosts and expenses in an effort to do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare\\ncustomers under our agreements with them. As we consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to\\nincur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or\\ncontractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all\\nrequirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is\\npossible that our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or\\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other actual or asserted\\nobligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized\\nloss, unavailability, corruption, use, release or other processing of personal information or other driver or rider data, or the perception that any of the foregoing\\ntypes of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform or result in\\nfines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations. Additionally, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or not valid, may harm our\\nreputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government and regulatory investigations and other legal and regulatory\\nproceedings, and in some situations we have received subpoenas and requests for documents and information, in the ordinary course of business, including\\nthose involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, driver earnings, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes,\\nantitrust, competition, consumer complaints (e.g., claims brought under the TCPA or other laws), intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory\\nrequirements, securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations and legal or\\nregulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new offerings, including proceedings related to product liability or our acquisitions, data\\nprivacy, advertising, securities issuances or business practices. We are also regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government\\ninvestigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the\\nsection titled “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\\n40\\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be\\npredicted with certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\\nrequire significant management attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive\\nprocess that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial\\ndamages, settlement costs, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These proceedings could\\nalso result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions or other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these\\nconsequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former\\ndirectors and officers.\\nA determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that involves our\\nindustry, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination related to driver classification matters, whether\\nwe are party to such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders and other parties on our platform. These\\nprovisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating\\ndisputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and\\nthe use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public\\nscrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be\\nrequired to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we\\nended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state\\nand federal law or between U.S. and foreign law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are\\nrequired to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and\\nwe could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs we expand our offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws\\nand regulations or manage the increased costs associated with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nAs we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from\\none jurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not\\ncontemplate or address the unique issues faced by our industry.\\nFor example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare\\nrelated laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides for healthcare\\ncustomers. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the\\ncosts associated with our offerings to healthcare customers. With respect to healthcare rides matched through the Lyft Platform and provided to Medicaid or\\nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such\\nlaws could lead to our loss of Medicaid provider enrollment status and could also potentially result in exclusion from participation in federal and state\\nhealthcare programs. Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which\\nwould expose us to certain risks such as the government’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding\\nauthorization, and the government’s administrative and investigatory processes.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings\\nor platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure\\nby our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our offerings, could harm our\\nreputation and brand, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of ride fares or result in fines or proceedings by\\ngovernmental agencies or private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate\\nfinancial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\\nand the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain\\n41\\nand improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we\\nwill continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of our controls and systems do\\nnot perform as expected, we may experience deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including\\nincreased complexity resulting from any international expansion, flexible work arrangements, new offerings on our platform or from strategic transactions,\\nincluding acquisitions and divestitures. Further, weaknesses or deficiencies in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting have been\\ndiscovered in the past, and other weaknesses or deficiencies may be discovered in the future. Our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control\\nover financial reporting are not expected to prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results\\nof operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to\\nimplement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and\\nannual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are\\nrequired to include in our periodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause errors in\\nour reporting. For example, our management determined that the clerical error in our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024\\ncontained in our initial press release issued on February 13, 2024 resulted in the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 at a reasonable assurance level. While we have remediated the deficiency that resulted in the error, failure of our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures or internal control over financial reporting to be effective could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information,\\nwhich would likely adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. We may also be subject to public scrutiny, regulatory inquiries and legal\\nproceedings if such failure results in an error in our financial reporting. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able\\nto remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial\\nreporting could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class\\nA common stock.\\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of comparable taxing authorities in foreign\\njurisdictions. As various levels of governments and international organizations become increasingly focused on tax reform, changes in tax laws, as well as other\\nfactors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax\\nliabilities. For example, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks that could impact us\\nin connection with a settlement of the capped call transactions. Further, a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct\\nresearch and development expenditures in the year incurred and requires the capitalization and amortization of such costs. The Organization for Economic\\nCooperation and Development (“OECD”) released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15% global minimum tax for large multinational companies. The OECD\\ncontinues to release additional guidance and countries are in various stages of implementation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected\\nin the near future. Any of these or other developments or changes in tax laws or rulings in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our effective\\ntax rate and our operating results.\\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar\\ntaxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as payroll tax, sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to\\nbusinesses like ours and to drivers is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established\\nbefore the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations,\\nand as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear\\nhow new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to drivers’ businesses. For example, we have an ongoing dispute with the City and County of San\\nFrancisco (“San Francisco”) regarding the application of gross receipts taxes to businesses like ours. For more information regarding this matter, please see the\\n“Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\n42\\nIn addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other\\nlegislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip\\nfees specifically on TNC rides. Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raised and may continue to raise questions about or\\nchallenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do\\nso or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring\\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could\\nresult in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing\\nour offerings or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of\\npossible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.\\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax\\ncollection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as\\na means to calculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. New legislation\\nmay require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, remittance and audit\\nrequirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\\nand any such difference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which\\nthe ultimate tax outcome is determined.\\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our\\nmanagement team have limited experience managing a public company.\\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are\\nsubject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\\nConsumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires,\\namong other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also\\nrequired to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has\\nincreased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we\\nmay be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to substantial additional costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our\\nbusiness in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial\\ncondition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with\\nthose requirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying those or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our\\nreputation or investor perceptions of it.\\nCertain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors\\nand complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage being a\\npublic company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities\\nanalysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from\\nthe day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\\nWe have established environmental programs, such as requiring our suppliers to ensure the efficient use of raw materials, water, and energy resources\\nvia our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our San\\nFrancisco, California headquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate change, as well as climate-related\\nevents including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their\\nimpact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our\\ncustomers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to\\nemerging climate change policies such as California’s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program that imposes certain greenhouse gas and EV requirements\\non our industry, and California climate-related reporting requirements such as California’s Senate Bill 253 (SB 253), Senate Bill 261 (SB 261) and Senate Bill\\n219 (SB 219). Massachusetts, New York City and Toronto are developing or have developed and implemented rules to address the environmental impact of\\nrideshare, and Illinois, New York and Washington are debating climate-related reporting requirements similar to California’s. Further, other jurisdictions are\\nlikely to consider similar rules, regulations and/or\\n43\\nreporting requirements in the future. Efforts to comply with these policies and reporting requirements are likely to increase our costs and any failure to meet the\\nrequirements could impact our ability to operate in the applicable jurisdiction. Failure to comply could also harm our reputation and brand. In addition, the SEC\\nhas proposed climate rules that will require disclosure regarding climate related information in our annual report, including material climate related risks,\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, material climate related goals and targets as well as governance related to climate related risks. These rules have been voluntarily\\nstayed by the SEC pending judicial review, but, if implemented, will require significant management time and attention as well as increased compliance costs.\\nWe often advocate for EV programs that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such\\nprograms to address EV capital costs, EV charging costs, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network companies’ unique needs\\ncould challenge our ability to progress toward internal and external EV targets. Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant\\ncapital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to\\nmaintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and\\nour financial condition may be adversely affected. If we are not able to allocate sufficient capital or other resources to these programs and achievement of these\\ngoals, we may not be able to make progress toward or achieve such commitments and goals in a timely manner or at all, or we may need to modify or terminate\\ncertain programs or goals. We may also enter into arrangements with third parties for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitments\\nand other legal or regulatory requirements. Such transactions may require us to provide guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits\\nfor EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to use them, we may not realize the benefits we have planned and our\\nbusiness and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. If we fail, or are perceived to fail, to make such progress or\\nachievements, or to maintain environmental practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations, or if we revise any of our commitments, initiatives, or goals,\\nour brand and reputation could be harmed and we may face criticism from the media or our stakeholders, and our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations could be adversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\\nHistorically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity and debt issuances and cash generated from\\nour operations. To support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including\\npotential new offerings. In November 2022, we entered into a $420.0\\xa0million revolving credit agreement, and since May 2020, we have issued $850.7\\xa0million\\nin aggregate principal amount of convertible notes. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities,\\nto finance our operations and growth or to refinance our existing indebtedness, among other things. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity,\\nequity-linked or debt securities, such as our 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the\\n“2029 Notes” together with the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”), those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common\\nstock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Further, we have secured debt financing which has resulted in fixed obligations and certain\\nrestrictive covenants, and any debt financing secured by us in the future would result in increased fixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive\\ncovenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it\\nmore difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development\\nefforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, uncertain and volatile\\nmacroeconomic conditions, including economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as slowing growth in the worldwide\\neconomy, inflation and high interest rates, as well as the instability and volatility in the banking and financial services sector, and the war in Ukraine, have\\nnegatively impacted the financing markets, and may impact our access to capital and make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less\\nfavorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing\\nor financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could\\nbe significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do\\nnot achieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new\\ntechnologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as\\nwell as divestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in\\nbusinesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other\\nopportunities that operate in relatively nascent markets. We also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may\\n44\\ndevelop. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and\\nentail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying,\\nnegotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities.\\nThese transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\\ncondition and results of operations, including:\\n•\\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to\\nconsummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\\n•\\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\\n•\\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\\n•\\nour ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\\n•\\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\\n•\\nchallenges related to entering into new markets or geographies;\\n•\\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\\n•\\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\\n•\\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\\n•\\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to\\nintellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\\n•\\nacquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and\\nregulations, including with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls,\\nsanctions and industry-specific-regulation;\\n•\\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that\\nwe become subject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways;\\n•\\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\\n•\\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\\n•\\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\\nIn addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in\\nFebruary 2023, we closed the sale of our vehicle service center business. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of PBSC, we became an indirect party to\\ncertain partnerships and joint ventures that we did not negotiate, and with partners with whom we are less familiar. These types of transactions present certain\\nrisks; for example, we may not achieve the desired strategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture, partnership, joint venture or other strategic\\ntransaction, or we may have difficulty operating together with another partner or joint venturer. In addition, in light of high interest rates and the volatility of\\nthe financial markets, it may be more difficult to find suitable acquirors or business partners, and during the pendency of a divestiture or during the integration\\nor separation process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and\\nthe risk that the transaction does not close.\\nFurther, minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal,\\noperational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the investment. In addition, we may be dependent on other persons or entities who control the\\nentities in which we invest, including their management or controlling shareholders, and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are\\ninconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\\nentities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment or result in litigation or regulatory action against us. We can provide no assurance\\nthat our investments in other technologies or businesses will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part.\\nFor example, in October 2022, one of our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment of $135.7\\nmillion consisting of impairments of our non-marketable equity investment in such company and other assets.\\n45\\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies,\\nservices and other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable\\nto successfully complete other transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition\\ncould be adversely affected.\\nServicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our\\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our\\nflexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\\nIn May 2020 and February 2024, we issued our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, respectively, in private placements to qualified institutional buyers. In\\naddition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, which is an independently managed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its\\nobligations under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as\\namended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party; and, following the acquisition, we continued to\\nguarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. As of December\\xa031, 2024, we had $995.0\\xa0million of indebtedness for\\nborrowed money outstanding. In November 2022, we also entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with certain lenders\\nproviding the ability to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $420.0\\xa0 million, none of which has been drawn as of December\\xa0 31, 2024, and\\n$72.6\\xa0 million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December\\xa0 31, 2024. On December 12, 2023, we entered into an\\namendment to the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, permits us to refinance the 2025 Notes and amends certain financial covenants. On\\nFebruary 21, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility was further amended to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace\\ntotal leverage with total net leverage and (b) permit us to repurchase up to a specified amount of the Company\\'s common stock with the proceeds of a\\nconvertible note offering. See Note 11 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt\\nobligations.\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest or fees on or to refinance or repay our indebtedness depends on our future\\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from\\noperations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required\\nto adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous\\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, general macroeconomic conditions and our\\nfinancial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a\\ndefault on our debt obligations. Events and circumstances may also occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and\\nutilize our revolving credit facility. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of\\nthese alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration\\nof our debt.\\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences.\\nFor example, it could:\\n•\\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in\\ngovernment regulation;\\n•\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\\n•\\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\\n•\\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\\n•\\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\\nIn addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative\\ncovenants regarding our business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in\\ncertain asset dispositions. If we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain\\nan amendment, waiver or consent from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and\\npayable. Further, any such amendment, waiver or consent that we are able to obtain may contain additional restrictions or terms that are less favorable to us.\\nAny debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and\\noperational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or\\ndivestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our\\n46\\nloans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks\\nrelated to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise\\nadversely affect our results of operations.\\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\\nadditional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and\\nrepurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict\\nour current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these\\ncovenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the\\nagreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare\\nall borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving credit\\nfacility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the\\ndebt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new\\nfinancing or negotiate an amendment, waiver or consent under our existing credit agreement, it may contain additional restrictions, or not be on commercially\\nreasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\\nIn connection with the issuance of our Notes, we entered into the capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers of\\nthe 2025 Notes or their respective affiliates for the 2025 Notes, and with certain financial institutions for the 2029 Notes (the “option counterparties”). We are\\nsubject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured\\nby any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an\\noption counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure\\nat that time under the Capped Calls with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be\\ncorrelated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may\\nsuffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to\\nthe financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, we had $7.2\\xa0billion of federal and $6.2\\xa0billion of state net operating losses (“NOLs”) available to reduce future taxable\\nincome, which will begin to expire in 2035 for federal income tax purposes and in 2025 for state income tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate\\ntaxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration. Under Section\\xa0382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes\\nan “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use\\xa0 its\\xa0 pre-change\\xa0 NOLs\\xa0 to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership\\nchange” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by\\xa0“5-percent\\xa0shareholders”\\xa0that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year\\nperiod. Limitations may apply under state tax laws. For example, recently enacted California legislation limits the use of state NOLs for tax years beginning on\\nor after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2027. As a result of this legislation or other unforeseen reasons, we may not be able to utilize some or all of our\\nNOLs even if we attain profitability.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other\\nthings, limited the use of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December\\xa031, 2017 to 80% of taxable income for tax years beginning after December 31,\\n2020. Not all states conform to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, these\\nchanges may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December\\xa031, 2017.\\nRisks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence\\nthe outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock. Accordingly, Logan Green, our co-founder and\\n47\\nChair of our board of directors holds approximately 18.81% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and Vice\\nChair of our board of directors, holds approximately 10.80% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or\\ntogether, may be able to significantly influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our\\norganizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders,\\nindividually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests.\\nThis concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an\\nopportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common\\nstock. Each Co-Founder’s voting power is as of December\\xa031, 2024 and includes shares of Class A common stock expected to be issued upon the vesting of\\nsuch Co-Founder’s RSUs within 60 days of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class\\xa0B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class\\xa0A common stock, subject\\nto limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert\\nautomatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-\\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the\\ndate on which the shares of Class\\xa0B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of\\nthe Class\\xa0B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or\\nIPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or become disabled of our Co-Founders, or such later date not to exceed a total\\nperiod of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are\\nbeyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause\\nfluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative\\nmarket sentiment;\\n•\\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or\\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those technology companies;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\\n•\\nsales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\\nor purchases could occur;\\n•\\nissuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with our equity incentive plans, an acquisition or upon conversion of our\\noutstanding Notes;\\n•\\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to\\nmeet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nthe financial and business projections, targets or goals we provide to the public, any changes in those projections, targets or goals or our failure to\\nmeet those projections, targets or goals;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\\n•\\ninvestor sentiment and the public’s reaction to our press releases, earnings and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of our\\ncompetitors or others in our industry;\\n•\\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nshort selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\\n•\\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\\n•\\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\\n48\\n•\\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\\n•\\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding\\npotential new laws or regulations;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\\n•\\nany significant change in our management or our board of directors;\\n•\\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\\n•\\nthe impact of our dual class structure.\\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class\\naction litigation has often been instituted against these companies, including as described in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 10. Commitments and\\nContingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and\\nwe intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer\\nor proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a\\nchange in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the\\ntransaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our\\namended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more\\ndifficult, including the following:\\n•\\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amendments by stockholders to our amended and restated bylaws require\\nthe approval of at least two-thirds of our then-outstanding voting power;\\n•\\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the\\noutcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A\\ncommon stock and Class B common stock;\\n•\\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office\\nfor cause;\\n•\\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\\n•\\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a\\nmajority of our board of directors;\\n•\\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\\n•\\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of\\nwhich may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\\n•\\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of\\nstockholders.\\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions\\ncould also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate\\nactions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our\\nClass A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\\n49\\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all\\ndisputes between us and our stockholders and also provide that the federal district courts will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”), each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability\\nto choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by\\nlaw, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary\\nduty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the\\nDelaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting\\na claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\\njurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over\\nindispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the sole and\\nexclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against any person in connection with any offering of\\nour securities, including, without limitation and for the avoidance of doubt, any auditor, underwriter, expert, control person or other defendant.\\nAny person or entity purchasing, holding or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented\\nto these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us\\nor our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find\\nthe exclusive-forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated\\nwith resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\\nItem 1B.\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments.\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\\nRisk Management and Strategy\\nWe have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity threats, and have integrated these\\nprocesses into our risk management systems and processes. We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized\\noccurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our\\ninformation systems or any information residing therein.\\nWe conduct a regular risk assessment process with monthly management reviews of the cybersecurity risk landscape to identify threats and may\\nconduct further assessments in the event of a material change in our business practices that may affect information systems that are vulnerable to such\\ncybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks, the likelihood and potential damage\\nthat could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and safeguards in place to manage such risks.\\nFollowing these risk assessments, we may accept identified risks; re-design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified\\nrisks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; and regularly monitor the effectiveness of our safeguards. We devote significant resources\\nand designate high-level personnel, including our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), to manage\\nthe risk assessment and mitigation process.\\nAs part of our risk management processes, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration with\\nhuman resources, IT, and management. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through trainings. We require\\nrelevant third-party service providers to confirm that they have the ability to implement and maintain appropriate security measures, consistent with all\\napplicable laws, to implement and maintain reasonable security measures in connection with their work with us, and to promptly report any suspected breach of\\nits security measures that may affect our company.\\nWe regularly discuss our internal controls over financial reporting with our independent registered public accounting firm and other service providers\\nassist us in evaluating the design and implementation of our cybersecurity controls and procedures, as well as to monitor and test our safeguards.\\nFor additional information regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition,\\nplease refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor entitled “Any actual or perceived security or privacy\\nbreach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.”\\n50\\nGovernance\\nOne of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats.\\nOur board of directors has oversight responsibilities for material risk for the company, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day\\nmanagement of the material risks we face. Our board of directors administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function as a whole, as well as through the audit\\ncommittee.\\nOur CISO has primary responsibility for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats in partnership with our CIO and other\\nbusiness leaders. The CISO has served in various roles within the cybersecurity field for over 15 years, including security leadership roles in multiple\\norganizations. The CISO holds an undergraduate degree in information security and forensics and a graduate degree in information assurance and has attained\\nvarious professional certifications within the field including Certified Information Systems Security Professional and Certified Ethical Hacker certifications.\\nOur CISO oversees our cybersecurity policies and processes, including those described in “Risk Management and Strategy” above. The processes and\\nprocedures by which our CISO is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents include our\\nincident response process, tracking in our centralized risk repository, and our vulnerability management process. Our Incident Response policy describes and\\nsupports the activities we take to prepare for discovery, response, and recovery from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to determine severity,\\nescalation, and response to incidents, as well as those necessary to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational\\ndamage.\\nOur CISO or other business leaders provide quarterly updates to the audit committee regarding our company’s cybersecurity risks and activities. These\\nupdates include any relevant recent cybersecurity incidents and related mitigation and remediation efforts, cybersecurity systems testing, status updates on\\nSecurity and Privacy team efforts, and the like. Our audit committee provides updates to the board of directors on material cybersecurity risks and activities.\\nItem 2.\\xa0Properties.\\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and consist of approximately\\xa0170,000 square feet under lease agreements through\\nAugust 31, 2034. We maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally in Toronto, Canada, Montreal, Canada, Mexico City,\\nMexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany and Munich, Germany.\\nWe lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that, should\\nit be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.\\nItem 3.

Market for registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\\nMarket Information for Common Stock\\nOur Class A common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “LYFT.” Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor\\ntraded.\\nHolders of Record\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, there were approximately\\xa0234 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A\\ncommon stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented\\nby these record holders.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, there were 6 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock. All shares of Class B common stock are beneficially\\nowned by either Logan Green or John Zimmer.\\nDividend Policy\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, and do\\nnot anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\\nStock Performance Graph\\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section\\xa018 of the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference into\\nany filing of Lyft, Inc. under the Securities Act.\\nThe graph below compares the cumulative five-year total stockholder return on our Class A common stock with the cumulative total return on the\\nS&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations focuses on a discussion of results for 2024 and 2023 and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023.\\nFor a discussion of results for 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 20,\\n2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences\\ninclude those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical\\nresults are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\\nFinancial and Operational Results for the Year Ended December\\xa031, 2024\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n% Change\\n(in millions, except percentages)\\nGAAP Financial Measures\\nRevenue\\n$\\n5,786.0\\xa0\\n$\\n4,403.6\\xa0\\n31%\\nTotal costs and expenses\\n$\\n5,904.9\\xa0\\n$\\n4,879.2\\xa0\\n21%\\nLoss from operations\\n$\\n(118.9)\\n$\\n(475.6)\\n75%\\nNet income (loss)\\n$\\n22.8\\xa0\\n$\\n(340.3)\\n107%\\nNet income (loss) as a percentage of revenue\\n0.4\\xa0%\\n(7.7)%\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\\n$\\n849.7\\xa0\\n$\\n(98.2)\\n965%\\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\\n$\\n(518.0)\\n$\\n599.8\\xa0\\n(186)%\\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n$\\n(155.9)\\n$\\n(122.1)\\n(28)%\\nKey Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nActive Riders for the fourth quarter\\n24.7\\xa0\\n22.4\\xa0\\n10%\\nRides\\n828.3\\xa0\\n709.0\\xa0\\n17%\\nGross Bookings\\n$\\n16,099.4\\xa0\\n$\\n13,775.2\\xa0\\n17%\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n382.4\\xa0\\n$\\n222.4\\xa0\\n72%\\nNet income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings\\n0.1\\xa0%\\n(2.5)%\\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross\\nBookings)\\n2.4\\xa0%\\n1.6\\xa0%\\nAdjusted Net Income\\n$\\n391.5\\xa0\\n$\\n250.7\\xa0\\n56%\\nFree cash flow\\n$\\n766.3\\xa0\\n$\\n(248.1)\\n409%\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nFor more information regarding our use of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial\\nMeasures”.\\n(2)\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a non-GAAP financial measure.\\n(3)\\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet.\\nDefinitions of Key Metrics\\nActive Riders\\nThe number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our user community.\\nActive Riders\\n2024\\n2023\\n(in millions)\\nThree Months Ended March 31\\n21.9\\n19.6\\nThree Months Ended June 30\\n23.7\\n21.5\\nThree Months Ended September 30\\n24.4\\n22.4\\nThree Months Ended December 31\\n24.7\\n22.4\\n(1)\\n(1)(2)\\n(1)(3)\\n54\\nWe define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is\\nidentified by a unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and that rider took rides using both phone\\nnumbers during the quarter, that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number,\\nthat person would be considered a single Active Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we\\nexclude this rider in the calculation of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\\nIn each of the three month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2024, Active Riders increased compared to the same\\nperiods in 2023 primarily due to our focus on rider engagement, improved retention and overall marketplace health which resulted in Active Riders reaching an\\nall-time high in the fourth quarter of 2024.\\nRides\\nRides represent the level of usage of our multimodal platform.\\nWe define Rides as the total number of rides including rideshare and bike and scooter rides completed using our multimodal platform that contribute\\nto our revenue. These include any Rides taken through our Lyft App. If multiple riders take a private rideshare ride, including situations where one party picks\\nup another party on the way to a destination, or splits the bill, we count this as a single rideshare ride. Each unique segment of a Shared Ride is considered a\\nsingle Ride. For example, if two riders successfully match in Shared Ride mode and both complete their Rides, we count this as two Rides. We have largely\\nshifted away from Shared Rides, and now only offer Shared Rides in limited markets. We include all Rides taken by riders via our Concierge offering, even\\nthough such riders may be excluded from the definition of Active Riders unless the ride is accessible in that rider’s Lyft App.\\nThe increase in Rides in the year ended December\\xa031, 2024 as compared to the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 was due primarily to our improved\\nmarketplace health which also resulted in both Rides and Active Riders reaching all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\\nGross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)\\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform.\\nWe define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, excluding\\ntips to drivers. Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter\\nrentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data\\naccess agreements. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross\\nBookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\\nThe increase in Gross Bookings in the year ended December\\xa031, 2024 as compared to the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 was due primarily to Rides\\ngrowth which benefited from increased ride frequency, which is demonstrated by Rides growth exceeding Active Riders growth, and improvements in\\nmarketplace health. Gross Bookings can be impacted by marketplace health and competitive dynamics and near the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, we\\nbelieve pricing pressure due to a dynamic competitive environment and softer ride volume had a moderate negative impact on Gross Bookings.\\nThe improvements in net income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross\\nBookings) in the year ended December\\xa031, 2024 as compared to the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 were due primarily to Rides growth due to competitive\\npricing and improved marketplace health. Additionally, our net income (loss) in the year ended December 31, 2024 included a $29.6\\xa0million gain related to a\\nlease termination which positively impacted net income (loss) as a percentage of Gross Bookings in the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, but did not have a\\nsimilar impact in 2023.\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations\\nthat use our Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from bikes and bike station\\nhardware and software sales, revenue from licensing and data access agreements and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties\\nthat are interested in reaching users of our platform. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates below and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive and our network of Light Vehicles, which\\nincludes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings is recognized in accordance with\\nASC 842 as described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\n55\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration\\nor if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily\\nincludes insurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations\\nfor ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also include occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees,\\nchargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, personnel-related compensation\\ncosts, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges and costs related to Flexdrive, which include vehicle lease\\nexpenses and remarketing gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone,\\nemail and chat support to users, Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, fees paid to third-parties\\nproviding operations support, facility costs and certain car rental fleet support costs. Light Vehicle fleet operations support costs include general repairs and\\nmaintenance, and other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Research and development costs\\nare expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or\\nriders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that\\nare generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative\\nfees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance\\ncosts and debt discount. Interest expense also includes interest incurred on our Non-Revolving Loan and our Master Vehicle Loan.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted and unrestricted short-term investments\\nas well as sublease income.\\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\\nOur provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state taxes in the U.S. and foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which we conduct\\nbusiness. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our\\noverall provision for income taxes in the future.\\nWe have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to maintain\\nthis valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. However, based on\\nour current and anticipated future earnings, our management believes it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive evidence of sustained U.S. profitability\\nmay become available in the foreseeable future to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. The timing and amount of the\\nvaluation allowance release could vary based on the level of profitability that we are actually able to achieve. A release of all or a portion of the valuation\\nallowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.\\n56\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2024\\n2023\\nRevenue\\n$\\n5,786,016\\xa0\\n$\\n4,403,589\\xa0\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n3,337,714\\xa0\\n2,543,954\\xa0\\nOperations and support\\n443,821\\xa0\\n427,239\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n397,073\\xa0\\n555,916\\xa0\\nSales and marketing\\n788,972\\xa0\\n481,004\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n937,348\\xa0\\n871,080\\xa0\\nTotal costs and expenses\\n5,904,928\\xa0\\n4,879,193\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n(118,912)\\n(475,604)\\nInterest expense\\n(28,921)\\n(26,223)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n173,183\\xa0\\n170,123\\xa0\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\\n25,350\\xa0\\n(331,704)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n2,566\\xa0\\n8,616\\xa0\\nNet income (loss)\\n$\\n22,784\\xa0\\n$\\n(340,320)\\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2024\\n2023\\nRevenue\\n100.0\\xa0%\\n100.0\\xa0%\\nCosts and expenses\\nCost of revenue\\n57.7\\xa0\\n57.8\\xa0\\nOperations and support\\n7.7\\xa0\\n9.7\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n6.9\\xa0\\n12.6\\xa0\\nSales and marketing\\n13.6\\xa0\\n10.9\\xa0\\nGeneral and administrative\\n16.2\\xa0\\n19.8\\xa0\\nTotal costs and expenses\\n102.1\\xa0\\n110.8\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n(2.1)\\n(10.8)\\nInterest expense\\n(0.5)\\n(0.6)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n3.0\\xa0\\n3.9\\xa0\\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\\n0.4\\xa0\\n(7.5)\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n—\\xa0\\n0.2\\xa0\\nNet income (loss)\\n0.4\\xa0%\\n(7.7)%\\nComparison of Years Ended December\\xa031, 2024 and 2023\\nRevenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n% Change\\n2024\\n2023\\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n5,786,016\\xa0\\n$\\n4,403,589\\xa0\\n31\\xa0%\\nRevenue increased $1.4\\xa0billion, or 31%, in 2024 as compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in demand as we benefited from improvements\\nin marketplace health which was reflected in the increases in Gross Bookings, Rides and Active Riders in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\\nEBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent\\nbasis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for:\\n•\\ninterest expense;\\n•\\nother income (expense), net;\\n•\\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes;\\n•\\ndepreciation and amortization;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\nsublease income;\\n•\\ngain from lease termination, if any;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings\\nfor the same period.\\nWe announced restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2022, second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024 to reduce operating expenses and\\nalign strategic priorities. We believe the costs associated with the restructurings are distinguishable from ongoing operating costs and do not reflect current or\\nexpected performance of our ongoing operations. We believe the adjustment to exclude the costs related to restructuring from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\\nNet Income (Loss) is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with our\\nhistorically disclosed Adjusted\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n60\\nEBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts. Refer to Note 15 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these\\nrestructuring plans.\\nWe sublease certain office space and earn sublease income. Sublease income is included within other income, net on our consolidated statement of\\noperations, while the related lease expense is included within operating expenses and loss from operations. We believe the adjustment to include sublease\\nincome in Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance, including the benefits of recent transactions, by\\npresenting sublease income as a contra-expense to the related lease charges within our operating expenses.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we terminated a portion of the lease for our San Francisco headquarters. The right-of-use asset associated with the\\nportion of this lease was previously impaired as part of our restructuring plans in the fourth quarter of 2022 and second quarter of 2023, and the extinguishment\\nof the remaining lease liability resulted in the recorded gain within operating lease costs. We believe this does not reflect the current period performance of our\\nongoing operations and that the adjustment to exclude this gain from lease termination from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to\\ninvestors by enabling them to better assess Lyft’s ongoing operating performance and provide for better comparability with Lyft’s historically disclosed\\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) amounts. Refer to Note 9 “Leases” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this\\ngain from lease termination.\\nFor more information regarding the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) and a\\nreconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Net income\\n(loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Net Income (Loss).\\nWe define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for:\\n•\\namortization of intangible assets;\\n•\\nstock-based compensation;\\n•\\npayroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\\n•\\ngain from lease termination, if any;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions and divestitures, if any;\\n•\\nimpairment charges, if any; and\\n•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as our management no longer uses this metric for\\npurposes of understanding and evaluating our operating performance.\\nFree Cash Flow\\nFree cash flow is a measure used by our management to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe free cash flow is a\\nuseful indicator of liquidity that provides our management, board of directors, and investors with information about our ability to generate or use cash to\\nenhance the strength of our balance sheet, further invest in our business and pursue potential strategic initiatives.\\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and scooter fleet.\\nFree cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and it does not represent the total increase\\nor decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a\\nmeasure of our ability to fund our cash needs. For more information regarding the limitations of free cash flow and a reconciliation of net cash provided by\\n(used in) operating activities to free cash flow, see the section titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nWe use our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the\\npreparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board\\nof directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be\\nlimited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include\\nthe impact of certain\\n61\\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should\\nbe considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP\\nfinancial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view\\nour non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2025, we will no longer present Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as our management no longer uses this metric for\\npurposes of understanding and evaluating our operating performance.\\nNet income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA.

The year over year improvement in net income (loss) was\\n$363.1 million, from a net loss of $340.3 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 to a net income of $22.8 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\n2024. Non-cash adjustments included stock-based compensation expense of $330.9 million, which decreased year over year due to a reduction in headcount\\ndriven by the restructuring activities initiated in prior years, and depreciation and amortization expense of $148.9 million. The changes in working capital were\\nprimarily driven by insurance, which saw (i) an increase in our insurance reserves due to a rise in commercial auto insurance rates on a per mile basis compared\\nto the prior year, an increase in ride volume in 2024 compared to the previous period and strategic risk\\n(1)\\n(2)(3)\\n(4)(5)\\n(1)\\n63\\nmanagement decisions to retain additional risk in certain markets, and (ii) an increase in insurance-related accruals. There was also an increase in certain loss\\ncontingencies, including legal accruals. These were partially offset by (i) increases to prepaid expenses for cash outflows related to our insurance activities,\\nincluding insurance premium payments and (ii) ordinary payments for our real estate operating leases. The timing of our scheduled driver payments also\\nimpacted prepaid and other current assets and accrued liabilities.\\nCash used in operating activities was $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consisted of a net loss of $340.3 million (which has\\na positive contribution to cash for the year as it was impacted by significant non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based\\ncompensations) which was primarily offset by changes in working capital of $(278.3) million. The year over year decrease in net loss from $1.6 billion to\\n$340.3 million was a result of an increase in our revenue and the actions we have taken to reduce our operating expenses. Net loss was also offset by non-cash\\nadjustments for stock-based compensation expense of $484.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $116.5 million. The changes in working\\ncapital were primarily driven by insurance, which saw (i) an increase in cash paid related to prepaid expenses and other assets driven by increases in premiums\\nyear over year due to higher rates and increased ride volumes, (ii) a decrease in our insurance reserves as insurance payments outpaced accruals in the period\\nand (iii) an increase in our cash outflow related to accounts payable due to the timing of insurance claims payments. There was also an increase in our cash\\noutflow related to accrued and other liabilities primarily due to settlement of historical legal and tax related liabilities.\\nInvesting Activities\\nCash used in investing activities was $518.0 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\\nsecurities of $4.2 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $83.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable\\nsecurities of $3.6\\xa0billion and the sale of property and equipment of $92.0 million.\\nCash provided by investing activities was $599.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of proceeds from sales and\\nmaturities of marketable securities of $3.9 billion and the sale of property and equipment of $92.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities\\nof $3.3 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $149.8 million.\\nFinancing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities was $155.9 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2024. This included a net cash inflow of $0.2 million for\\ntransactions related to the issuance of our 2029 Notes which included $460.0\\xa0million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes and expenditures of\\n$350.0\\xa0million related to the settlement of the 2025 Notes, $50.0\\xa0million related to the repurchase of Class A common stock, $47.9\\xa0million related to the\\npurchase of capped calls and $11.9\\xa0million in payments of debt issuance costs. Additionally, our financing activities included a repayment of loans of $84.1\\nmillion, principal payments on finance lease obligations of $46.7 million and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $40.3 million.\\nCash used in financing activities was $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of repayment of loans of $72.5\\nmillion and principal payments on finance lease obligations for $43.5 million.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nAs of December\\xa0 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of approximately $759.3 million and short-term\\ninvestments of approximately $1.2 billion, exclusive of restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.5 billion, and a revolving credit facility in an\\naggregate principal amount of $420.0\\xa0million as described below. The portion of our cash and cash equivalents that is not invested is held at several large\\nfinancial institutions and our investments are focused on the preservation of capital, fulfillment of our liquidity needs, and maximization of investment\\nperformance within the parameters set forth in our investment policy and subject to market conditions. The investment policy sets forth credit rating\\nminimums, permissible allocations, and limits our exposure to specific investment types. We believe these policies mitigate our exposure to any risk\\nconcentrations.\\nOn November 3, 2022, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $420 million senior secured revolving\\ncredit facility (as amended to date, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) maturing on November 3, 2027 or February 13, 2025, if, as of February 13, 2025, our\\nLiquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) minus the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes outstanding on such date is less than $1.25\\nbillion. We are obligated to pay interest on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type,\\nincluding an unused commitment fee. The interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility is determined based on calculations using certain market rates as set\\nforth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on payments such as\\ncash payments of dividends. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $168\\xa0million for the\\nissuance of letters of credit. We entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Agreement on December 12, 2023 and Amendment No. 2 on February\\n21, 2024 and such amendments amended the existing agreement to, among other things: (a) solely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace total\\nleverage with total net leverage, which allows us to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to the extent free cash flow for the most recently ended trailing four quarters is\\ngreater than $100.0 million, $300.0 million and (y) otherwise, $200.0 million and (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in the\\nAmended Agreement) on our consolidated balance sheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit us to\\n64\\nrepurchase up to a specified amount of our common stock with the proceeds of a convertible note offering. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain\\ncustomary events of default.\\nIn February 2024, we completed an offering of $460 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes in a private offering to qualified\\ninstitutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We used (1) approximately $350 million of the net proceeds to\\nrepurchase approximately $356.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes in separate and privately negotiated transactions entered into\\nconcurrently with the pricing of the offering with certain holders of the 2025 Notes effected through one of the initial purchasers of the 2029 Notes or its\\naffiliate, acting as our agent, (2) approximately $47.9 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the 2029 Capped Calls and (3) approximately $50 million of\\nthe net proceeds to purchase Class A common stock from institutional investors through one of the initial purchasers of the 2029 Notes or its affiliate, acting as\\nLyft’s agent, at a price per share equal to the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the pricing\\nof the 2029 Notes. Refer to Note 11 “Debt” and Note 12 \"Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans\" to the consolidated financial statements for information\\nregarding these transactions.\\nWe collect the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers at the time the ride is delivered using the rider’s authorized payment method,\\nand we retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement to drivers. Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our\\ncontracts with insurance providers require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the\\ninsurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as of December\\xa031, 2024 and 2023 were $1.4 billion and\\n$837.3 million, respectively.\\nWe have $2.0 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December\\xa031, 2024. We also have the ability to\\nborrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $420.0\\xa0million under the Revolving Credit Facility, none of which has been drawn as of December\\xa031, 2024,\\nand $72.6 million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December\\xa031, 2024. We believe that this provides sufficient liquidity\\nto meet our working capital, inclusive of short-term commitments such as the current portion of our convertible senior notes which we plan to settle with cash\\nin early 2025, and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. In the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, we achieved annual net income for the first\\ntime in our operating history. We plan to continue to focus on and actively manage our cash balances and liquidity, capital expenditures, working capital and\\noperating expenses. In particular, we continue to actively monitor the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, including tightening credit markets,\\ninflation and changing interest rates and have made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow which include headcount reductions announced in the third\\nquarter of 2024, second quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022. We have also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of\\ncertain facilities to align with our anticipated operating needs in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Refer to Note 15 “Restructuring” to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for information regarding these reductions in workforce.\\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, the effectiveness of our efforts to align our\\nexpenses with our current operating needs and short-term commitments, our ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing\\nmarket acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we\\nhave made reserves, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities, as well as satisfaction of our obligations with respect to any indebtedness. Further, we\\nmay in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies. For example, we intend to invest further in\\nEVs in order to achieve compliance with the California Clean Miles Standard which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by\\nthe end of 2030; the Massachusetts’ Climate Bill; New York City\\'s goal to get to 100% of rideshare rides in EVs or wheelchair accessible vehicles by 2030, and\\nthe City of Toronto’s push to bring the industry to 100% electric by 2030. In addition, in February 2025, we announced that our board of directors had\\nauthorized a program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market\\npurchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Refer to Note 17\\n“Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this repurchase program. From time to time, we have and we\\nmay in the future seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to\\nrefinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able\\nto raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. The terms of any additional financings or refinancings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility.\\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage\\nownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable\\nto raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n65\\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December\\xa031, 2024 (in millions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n12 months or less\\nThereafter\\nOperating lease commitments\\n$\\n228.0\\xa0\\n$\\n35.3\\xa0\\n$\\n192.7\\xa0\\nFinancing lease commitments\\n94.2\\xa0\\n35.3\\xa0\\n58.9\\xa0\\nLong-term debt, including current maturities\\n995.0\\xa0\\n429.1\\xa0\\n566.0\\xa0\\nOther noncancelable agreements\\n109.3\\xa0\\n10.2\\xa0\\n99.1\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIncludes the convertible senior notes issued in May 2020 (the \"2025 Notes\") and February 2024 (the \"2029 Notes\") with outstanding principal amounts of $390.7\\xa0million and $460.0\\xa0million,\\nrespectively, as of December\\xa031, 2024. The 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes mature on May 15, 2025 and March 1, 2029, respectively, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Refer to\\nNote 11 \"Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes.\\n(2)\\nDue to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals provided.\\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with\\nunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established\\nfor the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance\\nwith GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe\\nto be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our\\nestimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.\\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are\\nthe most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2\\nof the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by\\ndrivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers\\nenter into terms of service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists\\ndrivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a\\nresult, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for\\nriders.\\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service\\nprovided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a\\ntransportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their\\npromise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services,\\nthe drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to\\nthe rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a\\ntransportation service to a rider.\\nWe report revenue on a\\xa0net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount\\ncollected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do\\nnot contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the\\nLyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\\n(2)\\n(1)\\n66\\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract\\nexists between the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related\\ncharges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making\\nthe remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and\\nthe amount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare\\narrangement, as we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the\\ndriver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a\\nreduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the\\nservices rendered upon the completion of the ride.\\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration\\nor if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations\\nto request rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or\\na percentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications\\nover the applicable subscription period.\\nWe also recognize revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer. These revenues are\\nnot significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nWe generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and\\naccess to Flexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in\\ndelivering the data and access licenses and present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and\\nvehicle access, are determined by assigning the relative fair value, which represents the stand alone selling price, to each of the performance obligations.\\nRevenue is recorded ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as our respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.\\nRevenue was recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data until expiration of the rideshare contract in the second quarter of 2024. These revenues are not\\nsignificant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nWe have arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of our platform. These arrangements\\ngenerally require us to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period. These\\nrevenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nWe generate rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, an independently managed subsidiary, and our network of Light Vehicles. Under the Flexdrive\\nprogram, we operate a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease\\nor sublease vehicles to drivers and as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with\\nASC 842. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings\\non the Lyft Platform.\\nRevenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicles riders are recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated\\nfrom Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light\\nVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.\\nInsurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals\\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to\\ninsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal\\ninjury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these\\noutstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims\\nexperience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors for the insurance reserves and frequency and severity\\n67\\nassumptions for the insurance-related accruals, among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the\\nliabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we\\nmake certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant\\nassumptions related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related\\naccruals, and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of\\ntime the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for\\nevents that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is\\ndifficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we believe that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the\\nultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and\\nwhen amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets. We continue to review our\\ninsurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the legal, regulatory\\nand economic environment evolves.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value\\nof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess\\nof the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of\\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value\\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After\\nthe measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting\\nfees, are expensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a\\nqualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include,\\namong other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market\\nconsiderations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely\\nthan not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business. Certain\\nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a\\nloss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\\nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters\\nand related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\\nestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to\\nchange based on new information and future events.\\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For matters where the Company has\\nrecorded a probable and estimable loss, until the final resolution of the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized.\\nWe consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future\\ntaxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax\\nassets, including federal and state net operating loss\\n68\\ncarryforwards. We expect to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets\\nwill be realized. However, based on our current and anticipated future earnings, our management believes it is reasonably possible that sufficient positive\\nevidence of sustained U.S. profitability may become available in the foreseeable future to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer\\nbe needed. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on the level of profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve.\\nA release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the\\nperiod in which such release is recorded.\\nIn recognizing tax benefits from uncertain tax `positions, the Company assesses whether it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be\\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits. Evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes\\nare inherently uncertain and requires judgement and use of assumptions and estimates.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements as\\nof the date of this report.\\xa0\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency\\nexchange. Such fluctuations to date have not been significant.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $2.0 billion, which consisted\\nprimarily of institutional money market funds, certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and term deposits, which each carry a degree of\\ninterest rate risk, and restricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted investments of $1.5 billion. As of December\\xa031, 2024, we had long-term debt of $995.0\\nmillion, 39% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2025 Notes we issued in May 2020, and 45% of which consisted of the fixed-rate 2029 Notes we issued in\\nFebruary 2024. A hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nOur international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency\\nexchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains\\nor losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of\\nthe entities in which they are recorded. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a\\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n69\\nItem 8.

We also have audited the\\nCompany\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2022.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and\\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n71\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\\nand (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves and Insurance-Related Accruals\\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party\\ninsurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist,\\nauto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. As of\\nDecember 31, 2024, insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals totaled $1,701.4 million and $763.8 million, respectively. These liabilities are\\ndetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends and changes in claims experience. Management makes certain\\nassumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumption related to the\\ninsurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance-related accruals, and utilizes\\nactuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals is a\\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals; (ii) a\\nhigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial valuation techniques\\nand management’s significant assumptions related to loss development factors for the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance\\nrelated accruals; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves and insurance-related\\naccruals, including the controls over the development of the actuarial valuation techniques and the assumptions related to loss development factors for the\\ninsurance reserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness\\nand accuracy of historical data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating\\nthe reasonableness of management’s estimates by (a) developing independent estimates of certain insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals and\\ncomparing these independent estimates to management’s actuarially determined reserves; (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial\\ntechniques; (c) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions by independently developing loss development factors for the insurance\\nreserves and the frequency and severity for the insurance-related accruals based on loss reporting and payment experience and historical trends; and (d)\\nevaluating the consistency of management’s actuarial techniques period-over-period.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Francisco,

Description of Business\\nLyft, Inc. (the “Company” or “Lyft”) is incorporated in Delaware with its headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Company operates\\nmultimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Company’s platform and\\nmobile-based applications. This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers\\nwho have a vehicle with riders who need a ride. The Lyft Platform provides a marketplace where drivers can be matched with riders via the Lyft App where the\\nCompany operates as a transportation network company (“TNC”).\\nTransportation options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that\\nconnects drivers and riders in cities across the United States and in certain cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”), and the\\nExpress Drive program, where drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements with the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive Services, LLC\\n(“Flexdrive”) or a third party for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. In addition, the Company makes the\\nridesharing marketplace available to organizations through Lyft Business offerings, such as the Concierge and Lyft Pass programs, and generates revenue from\\nlicensing and data access agreements associated with the data from the Company\\'s platform, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware\\nand software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\\nStates (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\\xa0 All intercompany balances and transactions have been\\neliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported\\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\\xa0The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but\\nare not limited to, history and prior experience, expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making\\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those\\nestimates.\\nSignificant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims inclusive of insurance-related\\naccruals, fair value of financial assets and liabilities, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, leases, indirect tax obligations, legal contingencies, valuation\\nallowance for deferred income taxes, and the valuation of stock-based compensation.\\n2. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nSegment Information\\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the\\nChief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s\\nChief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making\\noperating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating\\nsegment. The Company has concluded that consolidated net income (loss) is the measure of segment profitability. The CODM assesses performance for the\\nCompany, monitors budget versus actual results, and determines how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income (loss) as reported in the\\nconsolidated statements of operations. There are no other expense categories regularly provided to the CODM that are not already included in the primary\\nfinancial statements herein.\\nDuring the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December\\xa031,\\n2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have material assets located outside of the United States.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S.\\xa0dollars as well as commercial paper and\\ncorporate bonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90\\n79\\ndays or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Also included in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for\\ncredit and debit card transactions.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for\\ninsurance purposes and amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.\\nInvestments\\nDebt Securities\\nThe Company’s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for\\nthe security, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S.\\ngovernment and agency securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.\\nThe Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The\\nentire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated\\nstatements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely\\nthan not required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair\\nvalue is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than\\namortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the\\nCompany\\'s assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company\\'s best estimate of the cash flows expected to be\\ncollected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of\\nthe security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\\nCredit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the\\nbalance sheet with an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are\\nrecognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\\nThe Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.\\nThe Company\\'s investments in debt securities include:\\n(i)\\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an\\noriginal maturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\\n(ii)\\nShort-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds,\\nwhich mature in twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\n(iii)\\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of\\ndeposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government and agency securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions\\npursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers.\\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the\\noccurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether\\nindicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and\\nmacroeconomic conditions, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information\\navailable, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds\\nthe fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\\nEnterprise and Trade Receivables\\nThe Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method.\\nUncollected fees are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and represent receivables from (i) participants in\\nthe Company’s enterprise programs (“Enterprise Users”), where the transactions have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have\\neither been invoiced or are unbilled as of the reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not\\nyet settled with third-party payment\\n80\\nprocessors. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities\\nfrom the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of\\nthe fare receivable to be remitted to drivers is included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected in accordance with\\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses”. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of\\nexpected credit losses inherent in the enterprise and trade receivables balance. In determining the expected credit losses, the Company considers its historical\\nloss experience, the aging of its receivable balance, current economic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact\\ncollectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be\\nuncollectible.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company\\ndeposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.\\xa0The Company has not experienced any losses\\non its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The\\nCompany limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the\\nsale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring\\nfair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the\\nhierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active\\nmarkets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by\\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are\\nrequired to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\\nThe carrying values of the Company’s debt securities, accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due\\nto the short period of time to payment.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to\\nthe Lyft Platform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. The Company has capitalized software development costs of $4.2 million, $8.1 million, and $12.1\\nmillion as of the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated\\nuseful life of the related asset, which is generally between one and eight years. Depreciation for property and equipment commences once they are ready for\\nour intended use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or\\notherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the\\nconsolidated statement of operations in the period realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the\\nlease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction in progress is related to property and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.\\nLeases\\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the\\narrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. The Company determines the classification and measurement\\nof its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leases or subleases the underlying asset in the\\nagreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain\\n81\\nagreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, the Company classifies the lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or\\nsales-type lease (both as a lessor):\\n•\\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\\n•\\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\\n•\\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of\\nthe economic life of the underlying asset;\\n•\\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\\n•\\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.\\nLeases that do not meet any of the above criteria are accounted for as operating leases.\\nLessor\\nThe Company\\'s lease arrangements include vehicle rentals to drivers or renters under the Flexdrive program and Light Vehicle rentals to single-use\\nriders. Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and\\nnon-lease components, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and\\nare recognized as revenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both\\nimposed on and concurrent with each lease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration\\nin its lease arrangements. The Company mitigates residual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and\\nthrough periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on the Company\\'s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.\\nLessee\\nThe Company\\'s leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing\\nservices on the Lyft Platform. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present\\nvalue of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\\nexercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected to do so for\\nvehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-\\nof-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\\nThe Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to\\ndiscount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate\\nof interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\\neconomic environment.\\nLease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are\\nincluded in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease\\ncosts for the Company\\'s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are\\nincluded in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are\\namortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements\\nof operations. The interest component of finance leases is included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the\\neffective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized primarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for\\nthose payments is incurred.\\nSimilar to other long-lived assets discussed below, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the\\nfuture undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment\\nrecognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For leased assets, such circumstances would include the\\ndecision to leave a leased facility prior to the end of the minimum lease term or subleases for which estimated cash flows do not fully cover the costs of the\\nassociated lease.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management’s\\nestimate of the fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to\\ntwelve years.\\n82\\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company\\nfirst performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-\\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required.\\nAlternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded\\nfor the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in\\nbusiness circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes\\nin performance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business\\nstrategy. The Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the\\nasset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the\\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. With the exception of impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets discussed in Note\\n9 “Leases” and disposals of fixed assets and other current assets discussed in Note 15 “Restructuring”, there was no other material impairment of long-lived\\nassets recorded for the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nInsurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals\\nThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured\\nretentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including\\npersonal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims\\nincurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of\\nthese outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, and changes in\\nclaims experience, including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors, and frequency and severity assumptions, among\\nother inputs and assumptions for the insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management,\\nan independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited\\noperational history. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors\\nas the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to\\ninsurance-related accruals,\\xa0and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim,\\nincluding the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge\\nin future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for\\ninsurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts\\nare adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle\\nthe liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for on the consolidated balance sheets. For example,\\ndisruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and result in rapid increases in insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can\\ninclude recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the high inflationary environment, increased litigation, and higher than expected losses\\nacross the commercial auto industry. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience\\ndevelops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\\nForeign Currency\\nThe Company uses the U.S. dollar predominantly as the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries. For foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar\\nis the functional currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of\\noperations. For the foreign subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into\\nU.S. dollars are recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the\\nLyft Platform and mobile-based applications. Substantially all, or approximately 85% or more, of the Company’s revenue is generated from its ridesharing\\nmarketplace that connects drivers and riders and is recognized in accordance\\n83\\nwith Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”). In addition, the Company generates revenue in accordance with ASC 606 from licensing and\\ndata access, subscription fees, revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services\\nto third parties, which are not significant components of the Company’s consolidated revenues. The Company also generates rental revenue from Flexdrive and\\nits network of Light Vehicles, which is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”).\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its rideshare marketplace in accordance with ASC 606. The Company generates revenue from service fees and\\ncommissions (collectively, “fees”) paid by drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully\\ncomplete rides via the Lyft App where the Company operates as a TNC. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each ride. Drivers enter into\\nterms of service (“ToS”) with the Company in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as\\nconsideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company\\nis acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting\\nthe fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider.\\nAs the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride\\nlapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate\\nthe completion of a successful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is\\nsatisfied upon the completion of the ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized\\ncredit card or other payment mechanism and retains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is\\nnot subject to significant judgment.\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based\\napplications over the applicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from bikes, bike station hardware and\\nsoftware sales when control is transferred to the customer in accordance with ASC 606.\\nThe Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to\\nprovide rideshare data and access to Flexdrive vehicles and bears the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. The\\nCompany is acting as a principal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance\\nobligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value, which represents the stand alone selling price, to each of the\\nperformance obligations. Revenue is recorded ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is\\nsatisfied upon the delivery of each. Revenue was recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data until expiration of the rideshare performance obligation in the\\nsecond quarter of 2024. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nThe Company has arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties that are interested in reaching users of the Company’s platform. These\\narrangements generally require the Company to provide advertising services over a fixed period of time for which revenue is recognized ratably over the\\ncontractual period. These revenues are not significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\\nRental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and\\nrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC\\n842.\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and\\nvehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers, and as a result, the Company considers itself to\\nbe the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease\\npayments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these\\ntransactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company\\ncollects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.\\nThe Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of\\narrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is\\naccounted for under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into\\nand provides the user the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement.\\n84\\nDue to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue\\ngenerated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is\\nrecognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less.\\nIncentive Programs\\nThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders and Light Vehicle riders to use the Lyft Platform.\\xa0Drivers generally receive cash incentives\\nwhile riders and Light Vehicle riders generally receive free or discounted rides under such incentive programs. Incentives provided to drivers and Light Vehicle\\nriders, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not the Company’s customers, incentives\\nprovided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.\\nDriver Incentives\\nThe Company offers various incentive programs to drivers, including minimum guaranteed payments, volume-based discounts and performance-based\\nbonus payments. These driver incentives are similar to retrospective volume-based rebates and represent variable consideration that is typically settled within a\\nweek. The Company reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria\\nby applying the most likely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a\\nreduction to revenue if the Company does not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the\\ngood or service received. Driver incentives for referring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an\\nexpense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or the established fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using\\namounts paid to third parties for similar services.\\nRideshare Rider Incentives\\nThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive\\xa0 programs, which\\xa0 are offered\\xa0 to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform.\\xa0 Generally, the\\nrider\\xa0incentive programs are as follows:\\n(i)\\nMarket-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a\\nspecific market. This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the\\ngross fare charged by the driver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this\\ntype of\\xa0incentive\\xa0as a reduction to revenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.\\n(ii)\\nTargeted marketing promotions. Targeted marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft\\xa0Platform to a targeted group of riders. An\\nexample is a promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during\\na limited period of time to a targeted group of riders. The Company\\xa0believes that the\\xa0incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied\\nto a limited number of rides are similar to marketing coupons. These incentives differ from the market-wide marketing promotions because they\\ndo not reduce the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for a specific market. During the promotion period,\\xa0riders not utilizing an\\nincentive\\xa0 would be charged the full\\xa0 fare. These incentives represent marketing costs. When a rider\\xa0 redeems the incentive, the Company\\nrecognizes\\xa0revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of the incentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.\\n(iii)\\nRider referral programs. Under the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral incentives when a new rider (the referee)\\ncompletes their first ride on the Lyft Platform.\\xa0The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer\\nwith the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Referral incentives typically expire\\xa0 within one year. The Company\\nestimates breakage using its historical experience. As of December\\xa031, 2024 and 2023, the rider referral incentives liability was not material.\\nLight Vehicle Rider Incentives\\nIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders were not material for the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nFor the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in relation to the driver, rider and Light Vehicle riders incentive programs, the Company\\nrecorded $777.4 million, $1.1\\xa0billion and $1.4\\xa0billion as a reduction to revenue and $423.2\\xa0million, $142.5\\xa0million and $109.8\\xa0million as sales and marketing\\nexpense, respectively.\\nRefunds\\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to riders unsatisfied by the level of service provided by the driver. There is no legal\\nobligation to remunerate such riders nor does the Company issue such credits or refunds to riders on behalf of the drivers. The Company accounts for credits or\\nrefunds, which are not recoverable from the drivers as sales and marketing expenses when incurred. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\\nrider refunds were $13.3 million, $19.7 million and $21.5\\n85\\nmillion, respectively. The Company accounts for credits and refunds issued to Light Vehicle riders as cost of revenue and was $4.1 million, $6.2 million and\\n$7.8 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nCost of Revenue\\nCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through the Company’s multimodal platform which primarily\\nincludes insurance costs, payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations\\nfor ridesharing and bike and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees,\\nchargebacks and failed charges. Other costs included in cost of revenue are hosting and platform-related technology costs, vehicle lease expenses, personnel-\\nrelated compensation costs, depreciation, amortization of technology-related intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of\\nvehicles.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone,\\nemail and chat support to users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental\\nfleet support costs, and fees paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and\\nmaintenance, and other customer support activities related to repositioning bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs related\\nto the Company’s autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of rider incentives, personnel-related compensation costs, driver incentives for referring new drivers or\\nriders, advertising expenses, rider refunds and marketing partnerships with third parties. Sales and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising\\nexpenses were $136.9 million, $122.0 million and $162.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs, professional services fees, certain insurance costs that\\nare generally not required under TNC regulations, certain loss contingency expenses including legal accruals and settlements, insurance claims administrative\\nfees, policy spend, depreciation, facility costs, and other corporate costs. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company incurs stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), stock options, and\\nthe 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) purchase rights.\\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-\\nScholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model incorporates various assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-\\nfree interest rates.\\nThe Company estimates the expected term for stock options using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” stock option awards. The expected term of\\nthe ESPP purchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period.\\xa0The Company estimates\\nvolatility for stock options and ESPP purchase rights using the historical volatility of the stock price of the Company and similar publicly traded peer\\ncompanies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S.\\xa0Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock\\noptions or ESPP purchase rights granted.\\nThe fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service\\nperiod. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically\\n12 months.\\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which is\\ndetermined based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and compensation expense for\\nPSUs is generally recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each individual tranche. Stock-based compensation\\nexpense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated\\n86\\nforfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.\\n401(k) Plan\\nThe Company adopted a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section\\xa0 401 of the IRC. Under the 401(k) Plan,\\nparticipating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not currently make\\ncontributions for employees.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.\\xa0 Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\\nrecorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.\\xa0These\\ndifferences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company\\nrecords a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers\\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all\\npositions taken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an\\nuncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any\\nrelated appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax\\nbenefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders when shares are issued\\nthat meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock and\\nparticipating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires\\nincome available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights\\nto receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods\\npresented.\\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number\\nof shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving\\neffect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable\\nto common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not\\nassumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of\\nthe fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition\\ndate. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining\\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record\\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and\\ncircumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of\\noperations and comprehensive income (loss). Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and\\nother interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are\\nvariable interest entities (“VIEs”). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical\\nand prospective information, among other factors. For\\n87\\nan entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such\\nentity into its consolidated financial statements.\\nThe Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling\\nfinancial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance;\\nand (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its\\nownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of\\nwhether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”, which\\namends and enhances the disclosure requirements for reportable segments. All disclosure requirements under this standard will also be required for public\\nentities with a single reportable segment. This new standard became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within\\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2024, which did not have a material impact on the\\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which requires companies to provide\\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new requirements will be\\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”, which requires companies to provide new\\nfinancial statement disclosures disaggregating prescribed expense categories within relevant income statement expense captions. This amendment is effective\\nfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, on a prospective basis and\\nearly adoption and retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of\\nConvertible Debt Instruments”, which seeks to clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be\\naccounted for as induced conversions. This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and for interim periods within fiscal\\nyears beginning after December 15, 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenue\\nDisaggregation of Revenue\\nThe table below presents the Company\\'s revenues as included on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nRevenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)\\n$\\n5,365,534\\xa0 $\\n4,116,216\\xa0\\n$\\n3,811,993\\xa0\\nRental revenue (ASC 842)\\n420,482\\xa0\\n287,373\\xa0\\n283,142\\xa0\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n5,786,016\\xa0 $\\n4,403,589\\xa0\\n$\\n4,095,135\\xa0\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the periods presented (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance at beginning of period\\n$\\n9.8\\xa0\\n$\\n11.6\\xa0\\n$\\n9.3\\xa0\\nChanges to provision\\n6.7\\xa0\\n(0.4)\\n1.9\\xa0\\nWrite-offs and recoveries\\n(4.3)\\n(1.4)\\n0.4\\xa0\\nBalance at end of period\\n$\\n12.2\\xa0\\n$\\n9.8\\xa0\\n$\\n11.6\\xa0\\n88\\nThe Company’s receivable balance included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets, which consists primarily\\nof amounts due from Enterprise Users and Light Vehicle partners, was $347.0\\xa0million, $315.0\\xa0million and $278.9\\xa0million as of December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and\\n2022, respectively.\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Acquisitions\\nAcquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (“PBSC”)\\nOn May 17, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of PBSC, a global leader in\\nbikeshare that supplies stations and bikes to markets internationally, for a total purchase price of $163.5\\xa0million inclusive of $14.1\\xa0million in estimated fair\\nvalue of contingent consideration. The acquisition was treated as a business combination and increases the Company’s scale in micromobility by leveraging\\nPBSC’s deep sales experience and customer relationships.\\nAcquisition costs were immaterial and are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company paid out earn out incentives of $15.0\\xa0 million, which were previously included in contingent\\nconsideration on the consolidated balance sheet. The earn out incentives were based on hardware and software for new system sales, either earned or\\ncommitted during the earn out period.\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n2,665\\xa0\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n34,845\\xa0\\nOther investments\\n22,175\\xa0\\nProperty and equipment\\n2,202\\xa0\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n786\\xa0\\nIdentifiable intangible assets\\n45,047\\xa0\\nTotal identifiable assets acquired\\n107,720\\xa0\\nAccounts payable\\n6,004\\xa0\\nAccrued and other liabilities\\n3,344\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities — current\\n292\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities\\n494\\xa0\\nOther liabilities\\n14,678\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n24,812\\xa0\\nNon-controlling interest (recorded to equity)\\n140\\xa0\\nNet assets assumed\\n82,768\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n80,748\\xa0\\nTotal acquisition consideration\\n$\\n163,516\\xa0\\nThe Company concluded the purchase accounting for the acquisition of PBSC during the second quarter of 2023. During the measurement period, the\\nCompany recorded immaterial purchase price adjustments resulting in a decrease in goodwill.\\nThe Company adopted ASU 2021-08 on April 1, 2022, prior to the acquisition of PBSC, the Company\\'s only acquisition in 2022. Upon the adoption\\nof this update, contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination are recognized and measured by the acquirer on\\nthe acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606 as if the acquirer had originated the contracts, which would generally result in an acquirer recognizing and\\nmeasuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree’s financial statements.\\nTherefore, PBSC’s historical deferred revenue balance as of May 17, 2022 has been included in the purchase price allocation in accordance with ASU 2021-08.\\nThe goodwill is attributable to (i) expanded sales opportunities for the Company\\'s current products and services by leveraging PBSC\\'s assembled\\nworkforce and (ii) cost synergies associated with economies of scale and a streamlined supply chain as the combined businesses operate on a global scale. The\\nacquisition is a non-taxable business combination and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\\n89\\nThe Company recorded intangible assets at their fair value, which consisted of the following (in thousands):\\nEstimated useful life (in\\nyears)\\nAmount\\nTradename\\n2\\n$\\n1,009\\xa0\\nCustomer relationships – cities\\n7 - 11\\n22,157\\xa0\\nDeveloped technology (hardware and software)\\n2 - 3\\n21,881\\xa0\\nTotal intangible assets\\n$\\n45,047\\xa0\\nThe fair value of the tradename was determined to be $1.0\\xa0million with an estimated useful life of two years. The fair value of the tradename was\\ndetermined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This involves forecasting avoided royalties, reducing them by taxes and\\ndiscounting the resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\\nThe fair value of the customer relationships – cities was determined to be $22.2\\xa0million with estimated useful lives between seven and eleven years.\\nThe fair value of the customer relationships – cities was determined using the multi-period excess earnings. The multi-period excess earnings approach\\ninvolves forecasting the net earnings expected to be generated by the asset, reducing them by appropriate returns on contributory assets, and then discounting\\nthe resulting net cash flows to a present value using an appropriate discount rate.\\nThe fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $21.9\\xa0million with an estimated useful life between two and three\\nyears. The fair value of the developed technology was determined using the replacement cost approach. In the replacement cost approach, the fair value of an\\nasset is based on the cost of a market participant to reconstruct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for any obsolescence. The fair value of the asset\\nwould include the expected profit margin a hypothetical third party developer would charge and a market participant buyer\\'s opportunity costs lost over the\\nperiod to reconstruct the substitute asset.\\nJudgment was applied for a number of assumptions in valuing the identified intangible assets, including revenue and cash flow forecasts, technology\\nlife, royalty rate, obsolescence and discount rate.\\nRefer to Note 16 “Variable Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the variable interest entities included in\\nthis transaction.\\nThe results of operations for the acquired business have been included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the\\nCompany\\'s acquisition of PBSC. PBSC’s results of operations for periods prior to this acquisition were not material to the consolidated statements of\\noperations and, accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\\n5. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods presented (in

Refer to Note\\n4 \"Acquisitions\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this contingent consideration.\\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values and the\\ncarrying value of these non-marketable equity securities are remeasured to fair value based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or\\nsimilar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other\\nincome (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIn June 2021 and June 2022, the Company received investments in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company without a readily\\ndeterminable market value as part of licensing and data access agreements. The investment had an initial carrying value of $128.1\\xa0million as of June 30, 2022\\nwhich was categorized as Level 3. The Company did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over this privately-held company and had elected to\\nmeasure this investment as a non-marketable equity security and classified it in other investments on the consolidated balance sheet. The entire amount of the\\ninvestment in the non-marketable equity security was impaired due to the announced winding down of the equity investee in October 2022. In addition to the\\nimpairment of this non-marketable equity security, an other asset was impaired, resulting in a total impairment of $135.7\\xa0million recorded to other income\\n(expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.\\nIn February 2022, the issuer of the Company\\'s $10.0\\xa0million investment in non-marketable equity securities in a privately held company was acquired\\nby a publicly-traded company. As a result of the acquisition in exchange for the securities in the privately-held entity, the Company received common stock of a\\npublicly-traded entity with a value of $8.4\\xa0million upon receipt, with the remainder to be received in cash. These shares are classified as marketable equity\\nsecurities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The shares are categorized as Level 1 and changes in fair value are recorded within other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

(“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share\\nReinsurance Agreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto\\ninsurance policies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2\\xa0million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the\\nterms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3\\xa0million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten\\nduring the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5\\xa0million, for a premium of $271.5\\xa0million (“the Reinsurance\\nTransaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement was on a funds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by PVIC from the insurance premium owed to\\nDARAG in order to pay future reinsurance claims on DARAG’s behalf. Upon consummation of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of\\n$251.3\\xa0million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurance recoverable was netted against the funds withheld liability balance\\nof $271.5\\xa0million for a $20.2\\xa0million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In\\naddition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5\\xa0million, additional coverage of certain legacy insurance liabilities was collateralized by a trust account\\nestablished by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0\\xa0million upon consummation. At the inception of the Reinsurance Agreement, a loss of\\napproximately $20.4\\xa0million for the total cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement of\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n95\\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2\\xa0million in cost of revenue and $0.2\\xa0million in general and administrative expenses.\\nCommutation of the Reinsurance Agreement\\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG entered into a Commutation Agreement, which effectively commuted and settled the previous Reinsurance\\nAgreement. Under the terms of the Commutation Agreement, DARAG released $89.3\\xa0million of assets held in trust to PVIC and the remaining balance of the\\nfunds withheld liability of $90.3\\xa0million from the Reinsurance Transaction for a total consideration of $178.6\\xa0million.\\nIn addition, the Commutation Agreement caused a DARAG affiliate, DNA Insurance Company (“DNA”), to simultaneously enter into an Adverse\\nDevelopment Cover Reinsurance Agreement (“ADC”) with PVIC (the Commutation Agreement and the ADC collectively referred to as the “Commutation\\nTransaction”). Under the terms of the ADC, DNA agreed to reinsure up to $20\\xa0million of the legacy insurance liabilities contemplated in the Reinsurance\\nAgreement for a premium of $1.0\\xa0million, which would be retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis. DNA also had the option to commute this agreement\\nfor $5.0\\xa0million prior to November 1, 2023, which would be offset by any premiums retained as funds withheld.\\nAs a result of the Commutation Transaction, the Company noted the following impacts on its financial statements:\\n•\\nThe Company recognized a $36.8\\xa0million gain in cost of revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2022, including amortization of a portion of\\nthe previously recognized deferred gain.\\n•\\nThe Company reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $247.4\\xa0million and the funds withheld liability balance by $90.3\\xa0million.\\n•\\nThe Company amortized deferred gains related to losses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement by $105.7\\xa0million.\\nOn February 8, 2023, PVIC and DNA entered into a Commutation and Mutual Release Agreement, whereby DNA agreed to exercise its option to fully\\nsettle and commute the ADC. DNA commuted the ADC for $5.0\\xa0million consisting of a $4.0\\xa0million payment made to PVIC and the release of $1.0\\xa0million\\npremium which was retained by PVIC as funds withheld. As a result, PVIC recognized a gain of $3.4\\xa0million, comprised of $2.4\\xa0million amortization of the\\nremaining deferred gain and $1.0\\xa0million related to the release of the funds withheld. PVIC also reduced its reinsurance recoverable by $4.0\\xa0million related to\\nthe payment received.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nThe following table sets forth the primary components of other income (expense), net as reported on the consolidated statements of operations (in\\nthousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nInterest income\\n$\\n166,304\\xa0 $\\n145,728\\xa0\\n$\\n47,142\\xa0\\nGain (loss) on sale of securities, net\\n(140)\\n(243)\\n(287)\\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net\\n(7,244)\\n3,657\\xa0\\n(4,387)\\nSublease income\\n3,527\\xa0\\n4,849\\xa0\\n11,591\\xa0\\nGain on equity method investment\\n—\\xa0\\n12,926\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nImpairment charges\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(135,714)\\nOther, net\\n10,736\\xa0\\n3,206\\xa0\\n(18,333)\\nOther income (expense), net\\n$\\n173,183\\xa0 $\\n170,123\\xa0\\n$\\n(99,988)\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company received investments in a non-marketable equity security in a privately held company.

These leases are classified as operating leases. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary from approximately one month to ten years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the lease\\nterm for periods varying from one month to ten years. These renewal options are\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n96\\nnot considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12\\nmonths or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments\\nrelated to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance or other services provided by the landlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease\\npayment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company amended the lease for its San Francisco headquarters, to terminate certain suites and extend the term of\\nother suites to 2034. As a result of terminating certain suites, a $29.6\\xa0million gain was recognized within general and administrative expenses as the right-of-\\nuse asset associated with a portion of this lease was previously impaired in 2022 and 2023 as part of restructuring, and the extinguishment of the remaining\\nlease liability resulted in the recorded gain.\\nFlexdrive Program\\nThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle\\nleasing companies. These leases are classified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2024, the remaining lease terms vary between one month to four years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as\\nsuch, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated to the respective lease component.\\nLease Position\\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands, except for remaining lease\\nterms and percentages):\\nDecember 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nOperating Leases\\nAssets\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n148,397\\xa0\\n$\\n98,202\\xa0\\nLiabilities\\nOperating lease liabilities, current\\n$\\n25,192\\xa0\\n$\\n42,556\\xa0\\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\\n152,074\\xa0\\n134,102\\xa0\\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n177,266\\xa0\\n$\\n176,658\\xa0\\nFinance Leases\\nAssets\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n79,704\\xa0\\n$\\n80,933\\xa0\\nLiabilities\\nFinance lease liabilities, current\\n$\\n31,268\\xa0\\n$\\n25,193\\xa0\\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current\\n54,351\\xa0\\n61,321\\xa0\\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n85,619\\xa0\\n$\\n86,514\\xa0\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\\nOperating leases\\n7.7\\n4.5\\nFinance leases\\n2.6\\n3.4\\nWeighted-average discount rate\\nOperating leases\\n6.6\\xa0%\\n6.7\\xa0%\\nFinance leases\\n6.4\\xa0%\\n6.7\\xa0%\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a $29.6\\xa0million gain in general and administrative expense as a result of a lease termination.

Under the most recent amended arrangement, the Company\\ncommitted to spend an aggregate of at least $350 million between February 2022 and January 2026, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four\\ncontractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December\\xa031, 2024, the Company has made payments of $350.6\\xa0million under the amended arrangement.\\nIn May 2019, the Company entered into a noncancellable arrangement with the City of Chicago, with respect to the Divvy bike share program, under\\nwhich the Company has an obligation to pay approximately $7.5 million per year to the City of Chicago through January 2028 and to spend a minimum of $50\\nmillion on capital equipment for the bike share program through January 2028. The parties modified the commitment amounts and timing in April 2023 to\\nreduce the Company’s payment obligation by $12\\xa0million and to supply a maximum of $12\\xa0million on capital equipment for the bike share program through\\n2024. As of December\\xa031, 2024, the Company has made payments totaling $33.6 million and capital equipment investments totaling $64.7 million under the\\narrangement.\\nAs of\\xa0December\\xa031, 2024, the future minimum payments under the Company’s noncancellable purchase commitments, which are inclusive of the\\narrangements mentioned above, were as follows (in thousands):\\n2025\\n$\\n10,229\\xa0\\n2026\\n89,396\\xa0\\n2027\\n9,711\\xa0\\n2028\\n—\\xa0\\n2029\\n—\\xa0\\nThereafter\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal future minimum payments\\n$\\n109,336\\xa0\\nLetters of Credit\\nThe Company maintains certain stand-by letters of credit from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business to guarantee certain\\nperformance obligations related to leases, insurance policies and other various contractual arrangements. None of the outstanding letters of credit are\\ncollateralized by cash. As of December\\xa031, 2024 and 2023, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $72.6 million and $60.2 million, respectively.\\n99\\nIndemnification\\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business\\npartners, investors, contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. The\\nCompany has agreed to indemnify and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from\\nactual or threatened third-party claims because of the Company’s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made\\nby the Company. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of\\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated\\nstatements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been material.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory and governmental inquiries and\\ninvestigations, and in some situations has received subpoenas and requests for documents and information, in the ordinary course of business, including\\ndrivers, riders, renters, third parties and governmental entities (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage and expense related\\nclaims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicable law,\\nor that the Company has not acted in conformity with such fees, rules or policies, as well as proceedings related to product liability, antitrust, competition, its\\nacquisitions, securities issuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the Company or the Company\\'s business. In addition, the Company has\\nbeen, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigation matters related to allegations of accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving\\ndrivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.\\nThe outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For certain matters for which a\\nmaterial loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor is the Company able to estimate the loss or range of\\nlosses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. For matters where the Company has recorded a probable and estimable loss,\\nuntil the final resolution of the matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\\nWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging\\nthe classification of these drivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and\\nother laws that would apply to driver employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change\\nand divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.\\nFor example, California Assembly Bill 5 (now codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2775) codified and extended an employment classification test\\nset forth by the California Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill\\nled to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California\\nAttorney General and the City Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly\\nmisclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors in violation of Assembly Bill 5 and California’s Unfair Competition\\nLaw, and on August 5, 2020, the California Labor Commissioner filed lawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the\\ncompanies’ respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive relief and material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court\\ngranted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers in California as employees until the end of the lawsuit.\\nSubsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for drivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to\\nmaintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. On April 20, 2021, the court\\ngranted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 5, 2021, the California Labor\\nCommissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The\\ncoordination petition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On December 19, 2022, the\\nCalifornia Attorney General’s and California Labor Commissioner’s cases were stayed in San Francisco Superior Court pending the appeal of a Superior Court\\norder denying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On September 28, 2023, the California Court of Appeal issued a decision upholding the trial\\ncourt’s order denying Lyft’s and Uber’s motions to compel arbitration. On November 7, 2023, the Company filed a petition requesting that the California\\nSupreme Court review the Court of Appeal’s decision; the petition was denied on January 17, 2024, and the case was remitted to San Francisco Superior Court\\non January 29, 2024. The stay was lifted by the trial court on July 2, 2024, and the parties are exploring mediation. On October 7, 2024, the U.S. Supreme\\nCourt denied the Company\\'s petition for writ of certiorari.\\nIn 2021, a group of petitioners led by labor union SEIU filed a separate lawsuit in a California court against the State of California alleging that\\nProposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services\\n100\\n(PADS) — the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 —\\nintervened in the lawsuit. In August 2021, the trial court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable, but in March 2023, the California Court\\nof Appeal reversed that decision and upheld Proposition 22, while severing two provisions that relate to future amendments of the measure. On July 25, 2024,\\nthe California Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and unanimously upheld Proposition 22.\\nCertain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations,\\nincluding damages, penalties and potential suspension of operations in impacted jurisdictions, including California. The Company’s chances of success on the\\nmerits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or\\nconflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another.\\nSeparately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as\\nindependent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Trial took place from May 13, 2024 to June 3, 2024. On June\\n27, 2024, the parties reached a resolution to dismiss the litigation with prejudice and Massachusetts drivers have begun receiving new benefits and maintained\\ntheir flexibility as independent contractors. The amount accrued for these matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nThe Company is currently involved in a number of putative class actions, thousands of individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or\\ncompelled pursuant to the Company\\'s Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California’s Private\\nAttorneys General Act, Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters\\nchallenging the classification of drivers on the Company’s platform as independent contractors. The Company is also defending against allegations that the\\nCompany has failed to properly classify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s\\nchances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nThe Company disputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. However, results of\\nlitigation, arbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate,\\ncould have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of\\nthese matters can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management\\nresources and other factors.\\nUnemployment Insurance Assessment\\nThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in\\nCalifornia, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Company believes that drivers are properly classified as independent\\ncontractors and plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The\\nCompany accrues for liabilities that may result from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable\\nand reasonably estimable, and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.\\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent\\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through March 31, 2018. The NJDOL\\nissued an assessment on June 4, 2019 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on March 31, 2021. On August 2, 2024, the NJDOL issued a revised\\nassessment, which is based upon a different methodology. The assessment was calculated through April 30, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions,\\npenalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2017. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and is awaiting a hearing. The Company has\\nalso submitted payment for the principal revised amount of the assessment to stop interest from accruing on this amount. While the ultimate resolution of this\\nmatter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as\\nof December\\xa031, 2024.\\nIn 2021, the New York State Department of Labor (“NYSDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors or\\nemployees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply for 2019. The NYSDOL subsequently extended the audit back to\\n2016. On December 22, 2022, the Company received an assessment for the 2016 to 2019 time period and on December 27, 2023, the Company received a\\nrevised assessment covering 2016 to 2020. The Company has appealed these assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, the\\nCompany recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nIn June 2022, the California Employment Development Department (\"EDD\") opened an audit reviewing whether drivers were independent contractors\\nor employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2018 to 2020. The EDD issued an assessment on June 9,\\n2023 and subsequently issued an updated assessment on June 27, 2023. The Company filed a petition to challenge the assessment, and is in discussions with\\nthe EDD regarding resolution. While the ultimate\\n101\\nresolution of this matter is uncertain, the Company recorded an accrual for this matter reflected within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nIndirect Taxes\\nThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily\\narises from disputes on tax treatment and tax rates applied to the sale of the Company’s services in these jurisdictions. The Company accrues indirect taxes that\\nmay result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is\\nrecorded to general and administrative expenses.\\nThe Company is currently engaged in an ongoing dispute with the City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) regarding the application of\\ngross receipts taxes to rideshare. On December 20, 2024, the Company filed suit against San Francisco and San Francisco’s Office of the Treasurer and Tax\\nCollector seeking refund of approximately $100\\xa0million in payroll expense tax, gross receipts tax, homelessness gross receipts tax, penalties, and interest for\\nthe 2019 through 2023 tax years. The outcome of this matter is uncertain.\\nPatent Litigation\\nThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to sell or license such\\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these\\nmatters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nOther Class Actions and Consumer Matters\\nFrom time to time, the Company becomes involved in putative class actions, investigations, and other matters alleging violations of consumer\\nprotection, civil rights, and other laws; antitrust and unfair competition laws such as California’s Cartwright Act, Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition\\nLaw; and the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, among others. In July 2024, the Company went to trial in federal court in New York to defend\\nagainst a class action alleging ADA and New York law violations with respect to the Company\\'s wheelchair accessible vehicle (\"WAV\") offerings, seeking\\ninjunctive and other relief, in Lowell v. Lyft, Inc. On September 30, 2024, the district court ruled that plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proof that the\\nmodifications they proposed at trial would result in nationwide WAV service. The district court dismissed the suit and entered judgment in favor of the\\nCompany. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on October 29, 2024, and the appeal is now pending before the Second Circuit Court of Appeal. The Company\\ndisputes any allegations of wrongdoing and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company’s chances of success on the merits\\nare still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nThe Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) alleged violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act in connection with certain advertising claims to drivers. The\\nCompany reached a settlement with the government to resolve this matter, which was approved by a court on November 1, 2024.\\nPersonal Injury and Other Safety Matters\\nIn the ordinary course of the Company’s business, various parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that the Company is\\nliable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers, riders or renters using or who have used services offered on the Lyft Platform, as\\nwell as from third parties. The Company is currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving drivers,\\nriders, renters and third parties. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses, disputes the allegations of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself\\nvigorously in these matters. There is no pending or threatened claim that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company’s\\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently\\nunpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial\\ncondition and results of operations. For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple\\nplaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating to alleged sexual assault or harassment by drivers on the Lyft Platform, and a Judicial Council Coordinated\\nProceeding has been created before the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, where the claims of multiple plaintiffs are currently pending.\\nOther legal proceedings related to accidents, alleged sexual assault or harassment, or other safety incidents are pending in various jurisdictions and may\\nsimilarly proceed to trial or final adjudication. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company\\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. Although the Company intends\\nto vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages of litigation and present\\na wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\\n102\\nSecurities Litigation\\nBeginning in April 2019, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts against the Company, its directors,\\ncertain of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the registration statement relating to the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) alleging\\nviolation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the IPO. All of these matters are now resolved except for\\nthe derivative actions, which were consolidated into one action in federal court in California. A proposed settlement was filed in the derivative action on July\\n23, 2024, and the court granted preliminary approval on October 16, 2024. A hearing on final settlement approval was held on February 6, 2025, and the matter\\nremains pending before the court.\\nOn February 13, 2024, the Company published a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 that was\\nfurnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed that same day. The press release contained a clerical error relating to the Company\\'s forward-looking,\\nnon-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024 (the “Clerical Error”). The Clerical Error was promptly corrected on the Company\\'s earnings call and\\nin an updated press release, and the Company filed an amended 8-K. Shortly after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") requested\\ninformation relating to the Clerical Error. The Company cooperated and responded voluntarily to the requests. On September 5, 2024, the SEC informed the\\nCompany that it had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company.\\nOn March 5, 2024, a putative class action, captioned Chen v. Lyft, Inc., et al., was filed against the Company, our principal executive officer, and\\nprincipal financial officer, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The putative class action alleges violations of the federal\\nsecurities laws relating to the Clerical Error. On September 13, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After a hearing on January 14,\\n2025, the court entered an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on January 16, 2025. The plaintiff had until February 6, 2025 to file an amended\\ncomplaint but did not do so.\\nAlthough the Company believes the consolidated derivative action and putative class action are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against\\nthem, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and these matters present a wide range of potential outcomes.

The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the\\nCompany with interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per\\nyear. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $733.2\\xa0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt\\nissuance costs.\\nThe initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes,\\nwhich is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $38.39 per share of the Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment\\nunder certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2025 Note Indenture.\\nThe 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding\\nFebruary 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances:\\n•\\nduring any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock, for at\\nleast 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading\\nday of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\\n•\\nduring the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as\\ndefined in the 2025 Note Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than\\n98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\\n•\\nif the Company calls such 2025 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day\\nimmediately preceding the redemption date; or\\n•\\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\\nNone of these conditions were met prior to February 15, 2025.\\nOn or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled\\ntrading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the\\ncase may be, cash, shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock, at the\\nCompany’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2025 Note Indenture.\\nHolders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change\\n(as defined in the 2025 Note Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate\\nevent constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Note Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a\\nportion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid\\ninterest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\\nIn February 2024, the Company, through privately negotiated agreements in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes (as defined below),\\nrepurchased approximately $356.8\\xa0million in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $350.0\\xa0million. The\\nCompany recognized this repurchase as an extinguishment of debt and recorded a gain on extinguishment of $5.1\\xa0million in other income (expense), net on the\\nconsolidated statement of operations.\\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the\\nCompany determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3\\xa0million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the\\nborrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2\\xa0million and was determined\\nby deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to\\nmeet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (“debt discount”) was\\namortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%.\\nFollowing the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion\\nfeature as a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component.\\nTherefore, less interest expense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating\\nthe subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of\\napproximately $140.0\\xa0million, net of tax,\\n104\\nto remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and equity component associated with the\\nissuance costs, an increase of approximately $133.5\\xa0million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full principal amount, net of issuance costs,\\nand an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5\\xa0million, net of tax in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with no impact to the Company’s\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nDebt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3\\xa0million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the\\ninitial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was $0.5\\xa0million on the consolidated balance sheets. The effective\\ninterest rate during the year ended December\\xa031, 2024 was 1.9%.\\nDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, the 2025 Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion.\\nBased on the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock on December\\xa031, 2024, the if-converted value of the 2025 Notes was\\n$131.3 million, which would not exceed the outstanding principal amount.\\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2029\\nIn February 2024, the Company issued $460.0\\xa0million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\"\\ntogether with the 2025 Notes, the \"Notes\") pursuant to an indenture, dated February 27, 2024 (the “2029 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S.\\nBank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee.\\nThe 2029 Notes mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the\\nCompany with interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024, at a rate of 0.625% per\\nyear. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $448.2\\xa0 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and debt\\nissuance costs. The 2029 Notes were not issued at a substantial premium, therefore, the Company did not recognize an equity component at issuance.\\nThe initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 47.4366 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes,\\nwhich is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.08 per share of the Class A common stock.

On September 12, 2024, the Non-revolving Loan\\nwas amended, extending the Company\\'s ability to draw through September 30, 2025. As amended to date, the Non-revolving Loan provides for a borrowing\\ncapacity of $50.0\\xa0million, though Flexdrive may request an extension of credit in the form of advances up to a maximum principal amount of $130 million to\\npurchase new Hyundai\\n106\\nand Kia vehicles, or for other purposes, subject to approval by the lender. Advances paid or prepaid under the Non-revolving Loan may not be reborrowed.\\nRepayment terms for each advance include equal monthly installments sufficient to fully amortize the advances over the term, with an option for the final\\ninstallment to be greater than the others. The repayment term for each advance ranges from 24 months to 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in arrears at a\\nfixed interest rate equal to the two-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a spread of 3.4% for a 24-month term, the three-year U.S. Treasury note yield plus a\\nspread of 3.4% for a 36 month term, and the average of the three and five-year U.S. Treasury note yields plus a spread of 3.4% for a 48 month term. The Non-\\nrevolving Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Non-revolving Loan. As December\\xa031, 2024, a total of $5.2\\xa0million had been drawn under the\\nNon-revolving Loan and $44.8\\xa0million is remaining under the facility.\\nThe Non-revolving Loan also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into\\ncertain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and\\ninsolvency events with respect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Non-revolving Loan may become immediately due and payable, among\\nother remedies. As of December\\xa031, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Non-revolving Loan in all material aspects.\\nFurther, the Company continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed.\\nMaster Vehicle Loan\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Master\\nVehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, dated February 7, 2020 as amended (the “Master Vehicle Loan”) with a third-party lender. Pursuant to\\nthe term of the Master Vehicle Loan, Flexdrive may request loans up to a maximum principal amount of $50\\xa0million to purchase vehicles and additional\\ncapacity may be requested. Repayment terms for each loan include equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the loan over the term, with an option for\\nthe final installment to be greater than the others and is typically equal to the residual value guarantee the Company provides to the lender. The repayment term\\nfor each loan ranges from 12 months to 48 months. Interest is payable monthly in advance at a fixed interest rate equal to the three-year swap rate plus a spread\\nof 2.10% on the date of the loan. Principal amounts outstanding related to the Master Vehicle Loan may be fully or partially prepaid at the option of Flexdrive\\nand must be prepaid under certain circumstances. However, if a loan is terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the minimum loan term Flexdrive will\\nbe obligated to pay to the lender, an early termination fee in an amount which is equal to the interest which would otherwise be payable by Flexdrive to the\\nlender for the remainder of the minimum loan term for that loan. The Master Vehicle Loan is secured by all vehicles financed under the Master Vehicle Loan as\\nwell as certain amounts held in escrow for the benefit of the lender. Amounts held in escrow are recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe Master Vehicle Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain\\nacquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency\\nevents with respect to Flexdrive or the Company, all amounts due under the Master Vehicle Loan may become immediately due and payable, among other\\nremedies. As of December\\xa031, 2024, Flexdrive was in compliance with all covenants related to the Master Vehicle Loan in all material respects. Further, the\\nCompany continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed following the acquisition.\\nThe fair values of the Non-revolving Loan and Master Vehicle Loan were $0.5 million and $154.5 million, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2024 and\\n$1.6\\xa0million and $121.2\\xa0million, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2023 and were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which are\\nconsidered a Level 2 valuation input. During the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, the Company made repayments of $84.1\\xa0million on these loans.\\nMaturities of long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities, as of December\\xa031, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\\n2025\\n$\\n429,079\\xa0\\n2026\\n61,623\\xa0\\n2027\\n54,264\\xa0\\n2028\\n—\\xa0\\n2029\\n450,081\\xa0\\nThereafter\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal long-term debt outstanding\\n$\\n995,047\\xa0\\nVehicle Procurement Agreement\\nFollowing the acquisition of Flexdrive by the Company on February 7, 2020, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Vehicle\\nProcurement Agreement (“VPA”), as amended, with a third-party (“the Procurement Provider”). Procurement services under the VPA include purchasing and\\nupfitting certain motor vehicles as specified by Flexdrive, interim\\n107\\nfinancing, providing certain fleet management services, including without limitation vehicle titling, registration and tracking services on behalf of Flexdrive.\\nPursuant to the terms of the VPA, Flexdrive will make the applicable payments to the Procurement Provider for the procurement services either directly or\\nthrough an advance made by the Master Vehicle Loan or the Non-revolving Loan. Interest on interim financing under the VPA is based on the prime rate.\\nThe Procurement Provider has a security interest in vehicles purchased until the full specified payment has been indefeasibly paid. The VPA contains\\ncustomary affirmative and negative covenants restricting certain activities by Flexdrive. As of December\\xa031, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all\\ncovenants of the VPA. As of December\\xa031, 2024, the outstanding borrowings from the interim financing under the VPA was $1.8 million which is included\\nwithin accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nOn March 11, 2019, the Procurement Provider entered into a $95.0\\xa0million revolving credit facility with a third-party lender to finance the acquisition\\nof motor vehicles on behalf of Flexdrive under the VPA. On September 17, 2020, the revolving credit facility was amended, extending the stated maturity date\\nto December 31, 2021 and reducing the borrowing capacity to $50.0\\xa0million. On March 11, 2019, Flexdrive entered into a Limited Non-Recourse Secured\\nContinuing Guaranty and Subordination Agreement with the third-party lender to guarantee the Procurement Provider’s performance for any amount borrowed\\nunder the revolving credit facility. As of December\\xa031, 2024, there was a $1.2\\xa0million exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee.\\nRevolving Credit Facility & Other Financings\\nOn November 3, 2022, Lyft, Inc. entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, as the\\nborrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto from time to time. The Company amended the Revolving\\nCredit Agreement on December 12, 2023, and on February 21, 2024, entered into Amendment No. 2 to Revolving Credit Agreement to, among other things: (a)\\nsolely for the purposes of the financial covenant test, replace total leverage with total net leverage, which allows the Company to subtract the lesser of (i)(x) to\\nthe extent free cash flow for the most recently ended trailing four quarters is greater than $100.0\\xa0million, $300.0\\xa0million and (y) otherwise, $200.0\\xa0million and\\n(ii) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in Amendment No. 2 to the Revolving Credit Agreement) on its consolidated balance\\nsheets as of the calculation date and (b) permit the Company to repurchase up to a specified amount of the Company’s common stock with the proceeds of a\\nconvertible note offering.\\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides the Company with a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in an\\naggregate principal amount of $420.0\\xa0million that matures on November 3, 2027. The Company’s Liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement)\\nminus the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2025 Convertible Notes (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) outstanding was not less than\\n$1.25\\xa0 billion as of February 13, 2025. As such, the Revolving Credit Facility did not mature on such date based on the terms of the Revolving Credit\\nAgreement. Subject to certain conditions precedent, the Revolving Credit Agreement also grants the Company the option to increase the commitment under the\\nRevolving Credit Facility by or obtain incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300.0\\xa0million, plus, after June 30, 2024, an unlimited\\namount so long as the senior secured leverage ratio does not exceed 2.50:1.00. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the\\nfacility, with a sublimit of $168\\xa0million for the issuance of letters of credit.\\nUnder the Revolving Credit Agreement, loans bear interest, at the Company’s option, at an annual rate equal to either (i) the sum of (x) the Adjusted\\nTerm SOFR Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus (y) a variable rate based on the Company’s total leverage ratio, ranging from 1.50% to\\n2.25% or (ii) the sum of (x) the highest of (A) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in effect in the United States, (B) the\\ngreater of the rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the federal funds effective rate or the rate that is published by the Federal Reserve\\nBank of New York as the overnight bank funding rate, in either case, plus 0.50%, and (C) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.00% and (y) a\\nvariable rate based on the Company’s total leverage ratio, ranging from 0.05% to 1.25%. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee between 0.225%\\nand 0.375%, depending on the Company’s total leverage ratio, per annum on the undrawn portion available under the Revolving Credit Facility.\\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions typical for a financing of this type that,\\namong other things, restrict the Company and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge or consolidate or make\\ncertain dispositions, pay dividends and make distributions or other restricted payments, engage in transactions with affiliates, and make certain investments and\\nacquisitions. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain (a) a minimum liquidity amount of at\\nleast $1.5\\xa0billion, tested on a quarterly basis, commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2022 through the quarter ending June 30, 2024, (b) a total net\\nleverage ratio not to exceed 3.50:1.00 commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024 through the quarter ending December 31, 2024 and\\ncommencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2025, a ratio not to exceed 3.00:1.00 (with an increase to 3.50:1.00 if the Company has an acquisition for cash\\nconsideration greater than $75\\xa0million for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition takes place and the three fiscal quarters immediately following such\\nacquisition), and (c) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The Revolving Credit\\nAgreement contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breach of representation or warranty or covenants, cross\\ndefault to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of certain change of control events. Non-compliance\\n108\\nwith one or more of the covenants and restrictions or the occurrence of an event of default could result in the full or partial principal balance of the Revolving\\nCredit Agreement becoming immediately due and payable and termination of the commitments.\\nThe Company’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s present and future material domestic\\nsubsidiaries. The Company’s obligations under, and each guarantor’s obligations under its guaranty of, the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by a first\\npriority interest on substantially all of the Company’s or such guarantor’s respective assets.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Revolving Credit Agreement and no amounts had been\\ndrawn under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, there were no other balances outstanding.\\n12.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Common Stock and Employee Stock Plans\\nCommon Stock\\nThe Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock. The\\nrights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Holders of Class\\xa0A\\ncommon stock are entitled to one\\xa0vote per share and holders of Class\\xa0B common stock are entitled to\\xa020\\xa0votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock are\\nconvertible into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer. Any\\ndividends paid to the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be paid on a pro rata basis. On a liquidation event, any distribution to\\ncommon stockholders is made on a pro rata basis to the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\\nCommon Stock Repurchase\\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes in February 2024, the Company repurchased 3,142,678 shares of its Class A common stock from\\ninvestors in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $50.0 million. The shares were repurchased at fair value and\\nthe entire repurchase price was allocated to the repurchase of the shares. The par value of the shares retired is charged against common stock and the remaining\\nrepurchase price is allocated to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company retired the shares upon repurchase.\\nEquity Award Plans\\n2008 Equity Incentive Plan\\nIn July 2008, the board of directors of the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) under which the Company may grant\\noptions to purchase its common stock and offer to sell and issue restricted shares of its common stock and issue RSUs to selected employees, officers, directors\\nand consultants of the Company. In June 2018, this plan was superseded by the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan) and all reserved shares under the\\n2008 Plan were transferred to the 2018 Plan.\\nUnder the 2008 Plan, incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options are to be granted at a price that is not less than 100% of the fair value of\\nthe underlying common stock at the date of grant; provided, that incentive stock options granted to a person who directly or by attribution owns more than ten\\npercent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company are to be at a price not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of\\nthe fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Stock options granted to newly hired employees typically vest 25% on the first anniversary\\nof the date of hire and ratably each month over the ensuing 36-month period. The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2008 Plan might not\\nexceed\\xa0ten years\\xa0from the date of grant. RSUs granted to newly hired employees typically vest 25% on the first Company-established vest date after the first\\nanniversary of the employee’s date of hire and ratably each quarter over the ensuing 12-quarter period for purposes of the service condition. The maximum\\nterm for RSUs granted under the 2008 Plan might not exceed\\xa0seven years\\xa0from the date of grant.\\n2018 Equity Incentive Plan\\nIn June 2018, the board of directors and the stockholders of the Company adopted the 2018 Plan, which serves as the successor to the 2008 Plan and\\nprovides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and RSUs to employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries\\nand non-employee directors of the Company. A total of 75,504,222 shares of the Company’s common stock initially was reserved for issuance under the 2018\\nPlan, which was increased in June 2018 by an additional 11,836,692 shares. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan also will include\\nany shares subject to stock options, RSUs or similar awards granted under its 2008 Plan that, after the date the Company’s board of directors initially approved\\nits 2018 Plan, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, are tendered to or withheld by the Company for payment of an exercise price\\nor for satisfying tax withholding obligations or are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company due to failure to vest (provided that the maximum number of\\nshares that may be added to its 2018 Plan from its 2008 Plan is 75,504,222 shares). Under the 2018 Plan, RSUs granted to newly hired employees typically vest\\n25% on the first Company-\\n109\\nestablished vest date after the first anniversary of the employee’s date of hire and ratably each quarter over the ensuing 12-quarter period for purposes of the\\nservice condition. The maximum term for RSUs granted under the 2018 Plan might not exceed seven years from the date of grant. In March 2019, this plan was\\nsuperseded by the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan) and all reserved shares under the 2018 Plan were transferred to the 2019 Plan.\\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan\\nIn March 2019, the board of directors of the Company and the stockholders of the Company adopted the 2019 Plan which serves as the successor to\\nthe 2018 Plan and provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and RSUs to employees and consultants of the Company\\nand its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company. RSUs granted with only service conditions under the 2019 Plan to employees generally vest in\\na period up to four years.\\nA total of 44,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class\\xa0A common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2019 Plan.

These PSUs are divided into individual performance\\nmilestones and vesting tranches tied to the Company’s stock performance. On the grant date, the Company valued these PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation\\nmodel to determine for each milestone (i) the fair value to expense for such tranche and (ii) the requisite service period when the milestone for such tranche is\\nexpected to be achieved. The Monte Carlo valuation model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards\\nincluding the Company\\'s stock price on grant date, expected term, expected volatility, and risk-free interest rate. The resulting fair value is amortized beginning\\non the grant date over the requisite service periods of each individual tranche.\\nAll PSUs are subject to a continuous service condition in addition to certain performance criteria.\\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $337.4 million,\\n$290.5 million and $354.3\\xa0million, respectively. In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, the Company withheld 2,528,016\\nshares and remitted cash payments of $40.3 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities.

In connection with RSUs that vested in the year ended December\\xa031, 2022, the Company withheld 358,330 shares and remitted cash payments\\nof $6.7 million on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities.\\nIn November 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved the transition to the net settlement method as the Company’s withholding method for\\nRSUs. Prior to this, the Company’s withholding method was the sell-to-cover method with the exception of RSUs held by officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)\\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for which the tax withholding method was the net settlement method.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost was $160.4 million related to all unvested awards. The Company expects to\\nrecognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.0 year. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the RSUs\\ngranted prior to the effectiveness of its IPO registration statement on March 28, 2019 using the accelerated attribution method.

The diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving\\neffect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common\\nstockholders, the dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the\\nif-converted method, as applicable. For purposes of this calculation, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2029 Notes, the 2025 Notes, and stock purchase rights\\ngranted under the Company’s ESPP are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share\\nattributable to common stockholders when including them has an anti-dilutive effect. Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common\\nstockholders are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods\\nindicated (in thousands, except per share data):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nNumerator\\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted\\n$\\n22,784\\xa0 $\\n(340,320) $\\n(1,584,511)\\nDenominator\\nWeighted-average shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share attributable to\\ncommon stockholders\\n409,181\\xa0\\n385,335\\xa0\\n354,731\\xa0\\nEffect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents\\n4,470\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nWeighted-average shares used in computing diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\\ncommon stockholders\\n413,651\\xa0\\n385,335\\xa0\\n354,731\\xa0\\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n0.06\\xa0 $\\n(0.88) $\\n(4.47)\\nDiluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n0.06\\xa0 $\\n(0.88) $\\n(4.47)\\n114\\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\\ncommon stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon\\nthe satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the period (in thousands):\\nAs of December\\xa031,\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\nRestricted stock units\\n1,407\\xa0\\n15,538\\xa0\\n20,542\\xa0\\nPerformance based restricted stock units\\n14,188\\xa0\\n14,553\\xa0\\n1,773\\xa0\\n2029 Notes\\n21,821\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n2025 Notes\\n10,178\\xa0\\n19,471\\xa0\\n19,471\\xa0\\nESPP\\n1,024\\xa0\\n111\\xa0\\n307\\xa0\\nStock options\\n—\\xa0\\n780\\xa0\\n993\\xa0\\nTotal\\n48,618\\xa0\\n50,453\\xa0\\n43,086\\xa0\\n_______________\\n(1)\\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into the Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, as\\ntheir effect would have been anti-dilutive.

As a result of the restructuring plan, in the second quarter of 2023, the\\nCompany recorded $47.2\\xa0million in employee severance and other employee costs and $9.7\\xa0million in net stock-based compensation expense related to equity\\ncompensation for employees impacted by the plan of termination. The Company also recorded $6.3\\xa0million in impairment charges, fixed asset write-offs,\\naccelerated depreciation and other costs to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets, which was primarily related to the cease use of certain facilities. As a\\nresult of the above, the Company incurred net restructuring charges of $63.3\\xa0million in the year ended December 31, 2023.

As a result of the restructuring plan, in the fourth\\nquarter of 2022, the Company recorded $29.5\\xa0million in employee severance and other employee costs and $9.5\\xa0million in net stock-based compensation\\nexpense related to equity compensation for employees impacted by the plan of termination.\\nThe Company’s plan of termination also included restructuring charges related to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to\\nalign with the Company’s anticipated operating needs. The Company reassessed its real estate asset groups and estimated the fair value of the space to be\\nsubleased using current market conditions. Where the carrying value of the individual asset groups exceeded their fair value, an impairment charge was\\nrecognized for the difference. During the year ended December 31, 2022, this included $55.3\\xa0million in impairment charges related to real estate operating\\nlease right-of-use assets, $23.9\\xa0million in accelerated depreciation of certain fixed assets and $2.1\\xa0million in write-off fixed assets not yet placed into service.\\nAs a result of the above, the Company incurred net restructuring charges of $120.3\\xa0million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the exit of certain leases as part of the plan of termination and the Company completed a\\ntransaction for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s first party vehicle services business. As a result, the Company recorded $10.5\\xa0million\\nin impairment charges related to the cease use of certain facilities to real estate operating lease right-of-use assets and other costs, which included $9.1\\xa0million\\nof future payments associated with exiting certain facilities. The Company also incurred employee related charges, which include employee severance, benefits\\nand stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2023.

As\\nof December 31, 2022, there were $1.6\\xa0million in restructuring-related liabilities.\\n16.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Variable Interest Entities\\nVIEs Related to the Acquisition of PBSC\\nAs part of its acquisition of PBSC, the Company acquired several joint ventures (“JVs”) which were deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”)\\nin accordance with ASC 810 Consolidation on the acquisition date. The Company determined that PBSC is the primary beneficiary of one of the acquired\\nVIEs, in which it owns an 80% equity interest, as PBSC has the power to direct the majority of the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its\\neconomic performance, the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits. As PBSC is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities,\\nnon-controlling interest, revenues and operating results are included in the consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the acquisition, PBSC entered into\\njoint ventures deemed to be VIEs which were accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial.\\nThe acquisition date fair value of the VIEs acquired as part of the PBSC acquisition was $22.2\\xa0million, which exceeded the carrying value and was\\nrecorded within other investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nOther than the VIE of which PBSC owns an 80% equity interest, the Company has determined that PBSC does not direct the activities that would\\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of these VIEs. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. As a result, the Company\\naccounts for its investment in these VIEs under the equity method, and they are not consolidated into the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In\\naddition, the Company recognizes its proportionate share of the reported profits or losses of these VIEs in other income (expense), net in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations, and as an adjustment to its investment in VIEs in the consolidated balance sheets. The profits and losses of these unconsolidated VIEs\\nwere not material to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December\\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nThe maximum potential financial statement loss the Company would incur if these VIEs were to default on all their obligations would be the loss of\\nthe carrying value of these investments as well as any current or future investments, if any, PBSC were to make which was immaterial as of December\\xa031,\\n2024.\\nOther VIEs\\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company contributed a business to a privately held company in exchange for an equity interest and a seat on\\nthe board of directors of such company. This privately held company was determined to be a VIE for which the Company lacks the power to direct the\\nactivities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the VIE.\\nHowever, due to the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence, the investment will be accounted for under the equity method. The investment was\\nrecorded at its initial fair value of $12.9\\xa0million and represents the Company’s maximum exposure to the VIE. During the year ended December\\xa031, 2024, there\\nwas no change in the Company\\'s claim on the net assets of the investment and therefore, the Company did not recognize equity method gain or loss nor was\\nthere an impairment of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an immaterial amount of equity earnings and there\\nwas no impairment of the investment.\\n117\\n17. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Subsequent Events\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nOn February 6, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to $500\\xa0million of the Company’s Class A\\ncommon stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market\\nconditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount\\nof its Class A common stock and may be suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a\\nvariety of factors, including the stock price, business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities,\\nacquisition opportunities, and other factors.\\n118\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act),\\nas of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\\nofficer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nour financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples.\\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December\\xa031, 2024.\\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-\\n15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,\\ncontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\\nItem 9B.

Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord that, with respect to the\\nGive Back Space, (a)\\xa0except for the Subleases, Tenant has not heretofore sublet the Give Back Space nor assigned all or any portion\\nof its\\n-2-\\ninterest in the Lease with respect thereto, nor shall any such transaction be in effect as of the Give Back Date, (b)\\xa0no other person,\\nfirm or entity has any right, title or interest in the Lease with respect to the Give Back Space, (c)\\xa0Tenant has the full right, legal\\npower and actual authority to enter into this Seventh Amendment including the termination of the Lease with respect to the Give\\nBack Space, the assignment of the Subleases to Landlord and the release of Tenant’s obligations with respect to the Sublease Space\\nand the Subleases, in each case without the consent of any person, firm or entity, and (d) the individual executing this Seventh\\nAmendment on behalf of Tenant has the full right, legal power and actual authority to bind Tenant to the terms and conditions hereof.\\nTenant further represents and warrants to Landlord that, to Tenant’s knowledge, as of the date hereof, there are no, and as of the Give\\nBack Date, there will be no, mechanic’s liens or other liens encumbering all or any portion of the Give Back Space by virtue of any\\nact or omission on the part of Tenant, its contractors, agents, employees, assigns or subtenants. The representations and warranties of\\nTenant set forth in this Section\\xa02.2 shall survive the termination of the Lease with respect to the Give Back Space and Tenant shall\\nbe liable to Landlord for any inaccuracy or any breach thereof.\\n2.3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Sublease Assignment.\\n2.3.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Sublease Assignment. Effective as of the Give Back Date, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all of its\\nright, title and interest in, to and under the Lease with respect to the Sublease Space and the Subleases, and Landlord hereby accepts\\nsuch assignment, assumes all of Tenant’s obligations under the Lease and the Subleases with respect to the Sublease Space, and\\nagrees to be bound by all of the provisions thereof and to perform all of the obligations of “Sublandlord” under the Subleases, from\\nand after the Give Back Date (the “Sublease Assignment”). The parties intend that following the Sublease Assignment, the\\nSubleases shall remain in place and in full force and effect as between Landlord and each subtenant, with Landlord as “Sublandlord”\\nunder each of the Subleases. The form of Sublease Attornment Agreement for each of the Subleases is attached hereto as Exhibit D-1\\nand Exhibit D-2. Each of the Sublease Attornment Agreements shall be executed concurrent with the execution of this Seventh\\nAmendment.\\n2.3.2\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Sublease Security Deposits. On or before the Give Back Date, Tenant shall pay and transfer to\\nLandlord the Security Deposits under each Sublease (in the amount of $48,793.50 under the GoFundMe Sublease, and $36,916.92\\nunder the Halliday Sublease).\\n2.3.3\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Further Assurances. Each of Landlord and Tenant agrees to execute such additional reasonable\\ndocumentation as may be reasonably deemed necessary to effectuate the intent of the parties with respect to the Sublease\\nAssignment.\\n2.4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0FF&E. Effective as of the Give Back Date, and in consideration of the Landlord’s agreement to terminate the\\nLease with respect to the Give Back Space and to take an assignment of Tenant’s interest in the Sublease Space and the Subleases,\\nTenant does hereby grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Landlord the items of fixtures, furniture and equipment (the\\n“Transferred FF&E”) located in the Give Back Space (other than the Sublease Space) as set forth on Exhibit\\xa0B attached hereto.\\nThe Transferred FF&E located in the Sublease\\n-3-\\nSpace is described in Exhibit D attached to the Halliday Sublease and in Exhibit D attached to the GoFundMe Sublease. Tenant\\nmakes no warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose in respect of the Transferred FF&E, and the same is sold in\\n“as is, where is” condition. Tenant hereby represents and warrants to Landlord that as of the Give Back Date Tenant shall be the\\nlawful owner of the Transferred FF&E, and that the Transferred FF&E shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances\\n(other than the rights of the subtenants under the Halliday Sublease and GoFundMe Sublease). The parties agree that this Seventh\\nAmendment shall serve as the bill of sale with respect to such transfer of the Transferred FF&E.\\n2.5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Roof Space. Effective as of the Give Back Date, the “Current Roof Space”, as defined in Section\\xa05 of the Sixth\\nAmendment, shall be revised to consist only of the portions of the Current Roof Space located on the Berry Street Building\\n(including the portions indicated as being on the “Interstitial Berry” Building). Such remaining roof space is listed on Exhibit C\\nattached hereto which shall be substituted for Exhibit B attached to the Sixth Amendment. On and after the Give Back Date, Tenant\\nshall have no further rights to use roof space on the Wharfside Building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the\\nLease, Tenant shall have no obligation to remove any Rooftop Equipment or to restore any portions of the roof of the Wharfside\\nBuilding.\\n2.6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Release. On and after the Give Back Date, Tenant shall be released from any and all obligations with respect to:\\n(A) the Give Back Space under the Lease arising from and after the Give Back Date, and (B) the Subleases, in each case to the\\nextent arising from and after the Give Back Date. Provided that Tenant has timely surrendered the Give Back Space (other than the\\nSublease Space which shall continue to be occupied by the respective subtenants) as provided in Section 2.1 above, each of Landlord\\nand Tenant shall unconditionally and fully waive, release and discharge the other party and each such party’s members, managers,\\nofficers, agents, investment advisors, employees, successors and assigns and all officers, directors, employees, agents, partners or\\nany other person or legal entity acting for or on behalf of any of the foregoing from any and all obligations, claims, actions,\\nliabilities, past, present and future, of whatever kind or character, known or unknown, by reason of, growing out of, arising out of or\\nexisting of the Lease solely with respect to the Give Back Space and Subleases or any of the terms or provisions thereof, or by\\nreason of the breach or alleged breach, or conduct or activity resulting in the breach or alleged breach, of any of the terms or\\nprovisions of the Lease solely with respect to the Give Back Space or either Sublease (collectively, the “Released Claims”). The\\nReleased Claims shall not include a release of Tenant’s indemnification obligations under the Lease with respect to third-party\\nclaims relating to incidents occurring within the Give Back Space prior to the date that Tenant surrenders the Give Back Space to\\nLandlord (the “Retained Claims”), which Retained Claims shall survive the termination of Tenant’s lease of the Give Back Space.\\nEach of Landlord and Tenant acknowledges that it is familiar with Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California which\\nprovides as follows:\\nA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor or releasing party does not know or\\nsuspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her,\\nwould have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\\n-4-\\nIn connection with the Released Claims, each of Landlord and Tenant hereby waives and relinquishes every right or benefit it may\\nhave under Civil Code Section 1542 and all other provisions of law with respect to any such claim it may have against the other\\nparty to the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment with regard to the Released\\nClaims, each of Landlord and Tenant acknowledges that it is aware that it may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different\\nfrom those which it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the Released Claims, but that it is such party’s intention hereby\\nto fully, finally and forever settle and release all such claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which may now exist or\\nwhich have previously existed between Tenant and Landlord with regard to the Released Claims subject to Tenant’s obligation to\\ntimely surrender the Give Back Space (other than the Sublease Space which shall continue to be occupied by the respective\\nsubtenants). Accordingly, provided that Tenant timely surrendered the Give Back Space (other than the Sublease Space which shall\\ncontinue to be occupied by the respective subtenants), each of Landlord and Tenant agrees that this Seventh Amendment shall be and\\nremain in effect as a full and complete release notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different facts\\nwith respect to the Released Claims.\\n2.7.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Survival.

(together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “Lyft”)\\nhas adopted this Insider Trading Policy (the “Policy”) in order to take an active role in the prevention of insider trading violations by our officers,\\ndirectors, employees and other related individuals.\\nWhy do we have this Policy?\\nOn a regular basis we provide you, our employees, with confidential information regarding many aspects of our business. Under federal\\nand state securities laws, it is illegal to trade in the securities of a company while in possession of material nonpublic information about that\\ncompany. Thus, because our employees will have knowledge of specific confidential information that is not disclosed outside of Lyft and which\\nwill constitute material nonpublic information, employee trading in our securities could constitute “insider trading” and violate the law, as could\\n“tipping” (giving material nonpublic information to) others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of insider trading\\nor the tipping of material nonpublic information can be severe. In fact, the person violating the laws, as well as Lyft and our individual directors,\\nofficers and other supervisory personnel, may be subject to criminal and civil lawsuits and financial penalties in connection with a violation of the\\ninsider trading laws.\\nNonpublic information about Lyft is subject to your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement and is not to be used\\nor disclosed outside of Lyft, except as necessary to perform your job duties. Unauthorized disclosure or use of nonpublic information, including\\nmisuse in securities trading, will subject you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. We have adopted this Policy\\nto comply with the laws governing (i) trading in our securities while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning Lyft and (ii)\\ntipping or disclosing material nonpublic information to outsiders, and in order to prevent the appearance of improper trading or tipping. We\\nreserve the right to prohibit any transaction from being completed or to require a transaction to be unwound to enforce compliance with this\\nPolicy.\\nWhat is Lyft’s policy on Insider Trading?\\n1.\\nDo not trade on material nonpublic information\\nWhether or not the trading window (as described below) is open and except as discussed in the section titled “Are there any\\nexceptions to this Policy?” below, you may not, directly or indirectly through others, engage in any transaction involving Lyft’s securities\\nwhile you are aware of material nonpublic information about Lyft. It is not an excuse that you did not “use” the information in deciding\\nwhether or not to engage in the transaction.\\nSimilarly, you may not engage in transactions involving the securities of any other company if you are aware of material nonpublic\\ninformation that you learn through your service to Lyft. For example, you may be involved in or aware of a proposed transaction involving a\\nprospective business relationship or transaction. If information about that transaction constitutes material nonpublic information for another\\ncompany, you are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving the securities of that other company. It is important to note that\\n“materiality” is different for different companies. Information that is not material to Lyft may be material to another company.\\n1\\n2.\\nDo not disclose material nonpublic information\\nYou may not disclose material nonpublic information concerning Lyft or any other company to friends, family members or any other\\nperson or entity not authorized to receive such information, except directly to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or other\\ngovernment, regulatory, or self-regulatory agency, in each case, in compliance with Lyft’s Whistleblower Policy. Any nonpublic information\\nyou acquire in the course of your service with Lyft may only be used for legitimate Lyft business purposes. In addition, you are required to\\nhandle the nonpublic information of others in accordance with the terms of any relevant nondisclosure agreements, including your Employee\\nInvention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement, and limit your use of the nonpublic information to the purpose for which it was\\ndisclosed.\\nEven if you are not directly disclosing material nonpublic information, you may not make recommendations or express opinions about\\nsecurities of a company, Lyft or otherwise, based on material nonpublic information about that company. In particular, you may not\\nparticipate, in any manner other than passive observation, in any Internet “chat” room, message board or social media platform messaging\\nrelated to trading in Lyft’s securities. You are prohibited from engaging in these actions whether or not you derive any profit or personal\\nbenefit from doing so. You should know that third parties are known to contact employees of companies to obtain information about the\\ncompany under false pretexts.\\n3.\\nDo not respond to outside inquiries for information\\nIn the event you receive an inquiry for information from someone outside of Lyft, such as a stock analyst, you should refer the\\ninquiry to our General Counsel or our Chief Financial Officer (each, a “Compliance Officer”). Responding to a request yourself is a violation\\nof this Policy and, in some circumstances, may be a violation of the law.\\n4.\\nTake personal responsibility\\nThe ultimate responsibility for complying with this Policy and applicable laws rests with you. As we request you do in all aspects of\\nyour work with Lyft, please use your best judgment at all times and consult with a Compliance Officer and/or your legal and financial\\nadvisors, in confidence, if you have questions.\\nWho does this Policy apply to?\\nThis Policy applies to all officers, directors and employees of Lyft (or “you”) upon the commencement of their relationship with Lyft. Lyft\\nmay also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material nonpublic\\ninformation.\\nReferences in this Policy to “you” (as well as general references to directors, officers and employees of Lyft) should also be understood\\nto include members of your immediate family, persons with whom you share a household, your dependents and any other individuals or entities\\nwhose transactions in securities you influence, direct or control. You are responsible for making sure that these individuals and entities comply\\nwith this Policy. This Policy is confidential and is subject to your Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement. Nonetheless,\\nyou may share this Policy with your spouse or domestic partner, financial planner, tax advisor or attorney on a need-to-know basis, provided the\\nconfidentiality obligations are maintained (i.e., those persons do not use this Policy in any manner other than to advise you, and they do not\\ndisseminate this Policy).\\nThe spirit of openness and trust in which we share information with our employees is key to our success as a company. In return, you\\nare expected to comply with this Policy as long as you hold Lyft’s\\n2\\nsecurities and possess any material nonpublic information about Lyft. This means that, even after you cease to be affiliated with Lyft, you must\\ncontinue to abide by the applicable trading restrictions until you no longer have material nonpublic information. In addition, if you are subject to\\na trading blackout under this Policy at the time you cease to be affiliated with Lyft, you are expected to abide by the applicable trading\\nrestrictions until at least the end of the relevant blackout period.\\nWhat types of transactions are covered by this Policy?\\nThis Policy applies to all transactions involving Lyft’s securities. This Policy therefore applies to purchases, sales and other transfers of\\nLyft’s common stock, options, restricted stock units, warrants, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities. This Policy also applies to\\nany arrangements that affect economic exposure to changes in the prices of these securities. These arrangements may include, among other\\nthings, transactions in derivative securities (such as exchange-traded put or call options), hedging transactions, short sales and certain decisions\\nwith respect to participation in benefit plans. This Policy also applies to any offers with respect to the transactions discussed above. Although\\nthere are limited exceptions to this Policy (described in “Are there any exceptions to this Policy?” below), please note that there are no\\nexceptions from insider trading laws or this Policy based on the size of the transaction (e.g., this policy applies whether a trade involves one or\\n10,000 shares of Lyft’s common stock).\\nTransactions that are Strictly Prohibited or Require Special Consideration\\n1.\\nOpen orders – You should exercise caution when placing open orders, such as limit orders or stop orders, with brokers, particularly\\nwhere the order is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period of time. Open orders may result in the execution of a\\ntrade during a blackout period, which may result in inadvertent insider trading.\\n2.\\nShort sales – You may not engage in short sales (i.e., the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery) or “sell short\\nagainst the box” (i.e., sell with a delayed delivery) if such sales involve Lyft’s securities. Short sales may signal to the market\\npossible bad news about Lyft or a general lack of confidence in Lyft’s prospects, and an expectation that the value of Lyft’s securities\\nwill decline.\\n3.\\nYou may not:\\na.\\nEngage in derivative securities or hedging transactions – You may not trade in publicly-traded options, such as puts and\\ncalls, and other derivative securities with respect to Lyft’s securities (other than stock options and other compensatory\\nequity awards issued to you by Lyft). This includes any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks\\nassociated with holding Lyft’s securities.\\nb.\\nUse Lyft’s securities as collateral for loans – You may not pledge Lyft’s securities as collateral for loans.\\nc.\\nHold Lyft’s securities in margin accounts – You may not hold Lyft’s securities in margin accounts because your broker may\\nsell securities held in the margin account during a blackout period.\\nWHAT DOES “MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION” MEAN?\\nInformation is “material” if a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell or retain our securities.\\nBoth positive and negative information may be material. Information is “nonpublic” until it has been widely disseminated to the public (through,\\nfor example, a press\\n3\\nconference or release) and the public has had a chance to absorb and evaluate it. Unless you have seen material information publicly\\ndisseminated, you should assume the information is nonpublic.\\nExamples of information that would normally be regarded as “material” include the following, although the list is not exclusive:\\n●\\nfinancial results, financial condition, projections or forecasts;\\n●\\nplans to launch new product features or new technologies;\\n●\\ngain or loss of a substantial customer, supplier or other business partner;\\n●\\nexecution or termination of significant contracts;\\n●\\nthe status of Lyft’s progress toward achieving significant goals;\\n●\\ninformation about new markets we may enter or developments in our existing markets;\\n●\\nchanges in regulations or applicable law;\\n●\\nsignificant litigation;\\n●\\ntechnical challenges, such as infrastructure stability or technical scalability issues;\\n●\\nmajor personnel changes, such as changes in senior management or the Board;\\n●\\ncybersecurity issues; or\\n●\\nsignificant corporate events, such as a pending or proposed acquisition or financing transaction.\\nFinancial information is particularly sensitive. For example, nonpublic information about the results of our operations for even a portion\\nof a quarter might be material in helping an analyst predict our results of operations for the quarter.\\nWhen in doubt, you should assume that the information is material and nonpublic. If you have any questions as to whether\\ninformation should be considered “material” or “nonpublic,” please consult with a Compliance Officer (our General Counsel or Chief\\nFinancial Officer -) or their delegate.\\nWhen may I trade in Lyft’s securities?\\nEven if you are not in possession of any material nonpublic information, you may only trade in Lyft’s securities if all of the following\\nconditions have been met:\\n1.\\nOpen trading window: You may only engage in transactions involving Lyft’s securities during an open trading window. Our trading\\nwindow will typically open at the start of the third full trading day following the date our quarterly financial results are publicly disclosed\\nand continue through the last day of the second month of the quarter. In addition to regular quarterly blackout periods, there may be\\nadditional blackout periods when appropriate due to certain events. We will notify you whenever a special blackout period goes into\\neffect that applies to you. (See “When is our Blackout Period?” below.)\\n2.\\nPre-clearance: If you are a member of the Board of Lyft (“Directors”) or a member of the executive team (“Executives”) or a Section\\n16 officer of Lyft, you must receive pre-clearance from a Compliance Officer of your proposed trade. From time to time, Lyft may identify\\nother persons who require pre-clearance, and a Compliance Officer will notify you that you are subject to pre-clearance. The Compliance\\nOfficer will maintain a list of persons subject to pre-clearance (the “Pre-Clearance List”). The Compliance Officer will determine the\\nmanner in which pre-clearance requests are to be submitted and persons on the Pre-Clearance List will be required to certify that they\\nare not in possession of material non-public information about the Company. If\\n4\\nyou are a Compliance Officer, you may not engage in a transaction involving Lyft’s securities unless the other Compliance Officer has\\npre-cleared the transaction. The Compliance Officers are under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance and\\nmay determine not to permit the transaction and notwithstanding any pre-clearance, you may not trade in Lyft’s securities if you\\nbecome subject to a trading blackout or possess material non-public information in advance of completing the trade.\\n3.\\n10b5-1 Plan: The SEC has enacted rules that provide an affirmative defense against alleged violations of U.S. federal insider trading laws\\nfor transactions made pursuant to trading plans that meet certain requirements, commonly referred to as “10b5-1 trading plans.” These\\ntrading plans must be entered into when you are not aware of material nonpublic information, must meet the requirements set forth in\\nRule\\xa0 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Rule 10b5-1”), and must meet the guidelines for such 10b5-1\\ntrading plans established by Lyft which you may obtain from a Compliance Officer, including pre-approval by a Compliance Officer.\\nTransactions made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan are not subject to the restrictions in this Policy, even if you are aware of material\\nnonpublic information at the time of the transaction or a blackout period is in effect.\\nDirectors and Executives are strongly encouraged, should they wish to trade in Lyft’s securities, to do so via a 10b5-1 trading plan.\\nAnyone else desiring to trade via such a plan may also do so in compliance with the specific guidelines established by Lyft. Trading plans\\nmust be pre-approved by and filed with a Compliance Officer and be accompanied by an executed certificate stating that the trading\\nplan complies with Rule\\xa010b5-1 and any other criteria established by Lyft. Information regarding a trading plan that you may enter may\\nbe publicly disclosed, as required by law.\\nIf you do not follow the above requirements, you may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of your\\nrelationship with Lyft, as well as civil and criminal penalties as described in the section titled “What are the consequences of Insider Trading?”\\nbelow.\\nWhen is our Blackout Period?\\nTo limit the likelihood of trading at times when there is a significant risk of insider trading exposure, Lyft has instituted quarterly trading\\nblackout periods and may institute special trading blackout periods from time to time. Whether or not a blackout period is in effect, you must\\ncomply with this Policy and may not trade on the basis of material nonpublic information.\\nQuarterly blackout periods\\nExcept as discussed in the section titled “Are there any exceptions to this Policy?” Directors, employees and agents may not engage in\\ntransactions involving Lyft’s securities during quarterly blackout periods. Quarterly blackout periods begin at the end of the last day of the\\nsecond month of each fiscal quarter and end at the start of the third full trading day following the date of public disclosure of the financial\\nresults for that fiscal quarter. This period is a particularly sensitive time for transactions involving Lyft’s securities from the perspective of\\ncompliance with applicable securities laws due to the fact that, during this period, individuals may often possess or have access to material\\nnonpublic information relevant to the expected financial results for the quarter.\\nSpecial blackout periods\\nFrom time to time, we may also implement additional blackout periods when, in the judgment of a Compliance Officer, a trading\\nblackout is warranted. We will generally impose special blackout periods when there are material developments known to us that have not yet\\nbeen disclosed to the public. For example, we may impose a special blackout period in anticipation of announcing interim earnings\\n5\\nguidance or a significant transaction or business development. However, special blackout periods may be declared for any reason.\\nWe will notify you if you are subject to a special blackout period. If you receive this notification, you may not disclose to others the fact\\nthat you are subject to the special blackout period and may not engage in any transaction involving Lyft’s securities until approved by one of our\\nCompliance Officers.\\nARE THERE ANY EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY?\\nYes, there are limited exceptions to this Policy, which are described below. Please note that there may be instances where you suffer\\nfinancial harm or other hardship or are otherwise required to forgo a planned transaction because of the restrictions imposed by this Policy.\\nPersonal financial emergency or other personal circumstances are not mitigating factors under securities laws and will not excuse a failure to\\ncomply with this Policy.\\n1.\\nReceipt, vesting and exercise of stock awards\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to the acceptance or purchase of stock options, restricted stock or the like issued\\nor offered by Lyft, nor do they apply to the vesting, cancellation, forfeiture of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock\\nappreciation rights or the acquisition or repurchase of shares pursuant to option exercises under our option plans.\\nIn addition, the foregoing is intended to include net share withholding with respect to equity awards where shares are withheld by the\\nCompany in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements, (x) as required by either the Company’s board of directors (or a committee thereof)\\nor the award agreement governing such equity award or (y) as you elect, if permitted by the Company, so long as the election is irrevocable and\\nmade in writing at a time when a trading blackout is not in place and you are not in possession of material nonpublic information.\\n2.\\nSale of shares to cover tax withholdings\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to sell to cover transactions where shares are sold on your behalf upon vesting of\\nequity awards and sold in order to satisfy tax withholding requirements, (x) as required by either the Company’s board of directors (or a\\ncommittee thereof) or the award agreement governing such equity award or (y) as you elect, if permitted by the Company, so long as the\\nelection is irrevocable and made in writing at a time when a trading blackout is not in place and you are not in possession of material nonpublic\\ninformation; however, this exception does not apply to any other market sale for the purposes of paying required withholding.\\n3.\\nPurchases from the Lyft Employee Stock Purchase Plan\\nThe trading restrictions in this Policy do not apply to elections with respect to participation in the Company’s employee stock purchase plan\\nor to purchases of the Company’s common stock under the plan. However, the trading restrictions do apply to subsequent sales of the\\nCompany’s common stock.\\n4.\\nStock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to a change in the number of securities held as a result of a stock split or stock\\ndividend applying equally to all securities of a class, or similar transactions.\\n6\\n5.\\nInheritance or change in form of ownership\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution or transfers for tax\\nplanning purposes in which your beneficial ownership and pecuniary interest in the transferred Lyft securities does not change. Some\\ntransactions that involve merely a change in the form in which you own securities may be permitted.\\n6.\\nTrades pursuant to a 10b5-1 Trading Plan\\nThe trading restrictions under this Policy do not apply to trades made pursuant to a valid 10b5-1 trading plan approved by the Company\\n(see above).\\n7.\\nOther exceptions\\nAny other exception from this Policy must be approved by a Compliance Officer in consultation with the Nominating and Corporate\\nGovernance Committee of the Board.\\nPlease be aware that even if a transaction falls within one of the exceptions described above, you will need to separately assess whether\\nthe transaction complies with applicable law.

Learn more on our API data privacy page.\\nOpenAI\\'s text generation models (often referred to as generative pre-trained transformers or\\n\"GPT\" models for short), like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, have been trained to understand natural and\\nformal language. Models like GPT-4 allows text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs\\nto these models are also referred to as \"prompts\". Designing a prompt is essentially how you\\n\"program\" a model like GPT-4, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to\\nsuccessfully complete a task. Models like GPT-4 can be used across a great variety of tasks\\nincluding content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and\\nmore. Read more in our introductory text generation guide and in our prompt engineering\\nguide.\\nAssistants refer to entities, which in the case of the OpenAI API are powered by large language\\nmodels like GPT-4, that are capable of performing tasks for users. These assistants operate\\nbased on the instructions embedded within the context window of the model. They also\\nusually have access to tools which allows the assistants to perform more complex tasks like\\nrunning code or retrieving information from a file. Read more about assistants in our\\nAssistants API Overview.\\nAn embedding is a vector representation of a piece of data (e.g. some text) that is meant to\\npreserve aspects of its content and/or its meaning. Chunks of data that are similar in some\\nway will tend to have embeddings that are closer together than unrelated data. OpenAI offers\\ntext embedding models that take as input a text string and produce as output an embedding\\nvector. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection,\\nclassification, and more.

For example, the string \"\\ntokenization\" is decomposed as \" token\" and \"ization\", while a short and common word like \"\\nthe\" is represented as a single token. Note that in a sentence, the first token of each word\\ntypically starts with a space character. Check out our tokenizer tool to test specific strings and\\nsee how they are translated into tokens. As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4\\ncharacters or 0.75 words for English text.\\nOne limitation to keep in mind is that for a text generation model the prompt and the\\ngenerated output combined must be no more than the model\\'s maximum context length.
